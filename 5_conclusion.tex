\begin{itemize}
  \item conclusion
  \item Tie everything with the main motivation of the work
  \item No details
  \item No need to be long (1-2 pages)
  \item How can we contribute to aid research in the carbon cycle/marine aggregate? What information we can give them?
  \item having an infinite-like fluid domain does not suggest the aggregate can behave like a sphere
  \item Or this cannot justify the aggregate dynamics 
  \item Having a fractal structured aggregate would allow us to have more qualitative data to examine the local carbon cycle near the aggregate
  \item what other measurement is required to contribute in the marine biology or oceanography field?
\end{itemize}
