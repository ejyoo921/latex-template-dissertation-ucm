@article{chauchat_three-dimensional_2014,
	abstract = {This paper presents a three-dimensional implementation of the so-called $\mu(I)$ rheology to accurately and efficiently compute steady-state dense granular flows. The tricky pressure dependent visco-plastic behaviour within an incompressible flow solver has been overcome using a regularisation technique along with a complete derivation of the incremental formulation associated with the Newton-Raphson algorithm. The computational accuracy and efficiency of the proposed numerical model have been assessed on two representative problems that have an analytical solution. Then, two application examples dealing with actual lab experiments have also been considered: the first one concerns a granular flow on a heap and the second one deals with the granular flow around a cylinder. In both configurations the obtained computational results are in good agreement with available experimental data.},

@article{thakral_compression-induced_2019,
	abstract = {Our goals were to evaluate the effects of (i) hydrostatic pressure alone and (ii) its combined effect with shear stress during compaction, on the polymorphic transformation (form C → A) of a model drug, chlorpropamide. The powder was either subjected to hydrostatic pressure in a pressure vessel or compressed in a tablet press, at pressures ranging from 25 to 150 MPa. The overall extent of phase transformation was determined by powder X-ray diffractometry, whereas 2D-X-ray diffractometry enabled quantification of the spatial distribution of phase composition in tablets. Irrespective of the pressure, the extent of transformation following compaction was higher than that because of hydrostatic pressure alone, the difference attributed to the contribution of shear stress experienced during compaction. At a compression pressure of 25 MPa, there was a pronounced gradient in the extent of phase transformation when monitored from radial tablet surface to core. This gradient decreased with increase in compression pressure. Four approaches were attempted to minimize the effect of compression-induced phase transformation: (a) site-specific lubrication, (b) use of a viscoelastic excipient, (c) ceramic-lined die, and (d) use of cavity tablet. The ceramic-lined die coupled with site-specific lubrication was most effective in minimizing the extent of compression-induced phase transformation.},

@book{simo_computational_2000,
	abstract = {This book goes back a long way. There is a tradition of research and teaching in inelasticity at Stanford that goes back at least to Wilhelm Flugge ̈ and Erastus Lee. I joined the faculty in 1980, and shortly thereafter the Chairman of the Applied Mechanics Division, George Herrmann, asked me to present a course in plasticity. I decided to develop a new two-quarter sequence entitled ``Theoretical and C- putational Plasticity'' which combined the basic theory I had learned as a graduate student at the University of California at Berkeley from David Bogy, James Kelly, Jacob Lubliner, and Paul Naghdi with new computational techniques from the ?nite-element literature and my personal research. I taught the course a couple of times and developed a set of notes that I passed on to Juan Simo when he joined thefacultyin1985. IwasChairmanatthattimeandIaskedJuantofurtherdevelop the course into a full year covering inelasticity from a more comprehensive p- spective. Juan embarked on this path creating what was to become his signature course. He eventually renamed it ``Computational and Theoretical Inelasticity'' and it covered much of the material that was the basis of his research in material modeling and simulation for which he achieved international recognition. At the outset we decided to write a book that would cover the material in the course.},

@article{artoni_effective_2014,
	abstract = {Wall slip is an important phenomenon for the flow of granular materials in chutes and channels. The appearance of a slip velocity at the wall critically affects wall stresses and flow profiles, and particularly the total flowrate. In this work we show, through numerical simulations and experiments, that the global slip phenomenon at a wall has peculiar features which deviate significantly from simple sliding behavior. At first we present experimental data for the vertical chute flow which highlight that wall slip depends on many operating and system variables such as flow rate, material properties, wall properties. Secondly, we resume a large campaign of numerical data performed in 2D with polygonal particles, and try to analyse the effect of material properties, contact parameters, operating variables, different flow configurations, on the slip phenomenon. The numerical campaign allowed to identify the main parameters affecting the wall slip behavior of a numerical model of granular flow, providing the ingredients for the creation of a framework for the description of wall slip.},

@article{sverdrup_highly_2018,
	abstract = {We present the extension of an efficient and highly parallelisable framework for incompressible fluid flow simulations to viscoplastic fluids. The system is governed by incompressible conservation of mass, the Cauchy momentum equation, and a generalised Newtonian constitutive law. In order to simulate a wide range of viscoplastic fluids, we employ the Herschel-Bulkley model for yield-stress fluids with nonlinear stress-strain dependency above the yield limit. We utilise Papanastasiou regularisation in our algorithm to deal with the singularity in apparent viscosity. The resulting system of partial differential equations is solved using the IAMR (Incompressible Adaptive Mesh Refinement) code, which uses second-order Godunov methodology for the advective terms and semi-implicit diffusion in the context of an approximate projection method to solve adaptively refined meshes. By augmenting the IAMR code with the ability to simulate regularised Herschel-Bulkley fluids, we obtain efficient numerical software for time-dependent viscoplastic flow in three dimensions, which can be used to investigate systems not considered previously due to computational expense. We validate results from simulations using this new capability against previously published data for Bingham plastics and power-law fluids in the two-dimensional lid-driven cavity. In doing so, we expand the range of Bingham and Reynolds numbers which have been considered in the benchmark tests. Moreover, extensions to time-dependent flow of Herschel-Bulkley fluids and three spatial dimensions offer new insights into the flow of viscoplastic fluids in this test case, and we provide missing benchmark results for these extensions.},

@article{kim_power-law_2020,

Rescaling the stress ratio $\mu$ by a power of dimensionless temperature Θ makes the data from a wide set of flow geometries collapse to a master curve depending only on the inertial number I. The basic power-law structure appears robust to varying particle properties (e.g., surface friction) in both 2D and 3D systems. We show how this rheology fits and extends frameworks such as kinetic theory and the nonlocal granular fluidity model.},

	abstract = {Laboratory experiments have shown that the steady flow of granular material down a rough inclined plane has a surface that is not parallel to the plane, but has a curvature across the slope with the height increasing toward the middle of the flow. We study this observation by postulating a new granular rheology, similar to that of a second order fluid. This model is applied to the experiments using a shallow water approximation, given that the depth of the flow is much smaller than the width. The model predicts that a second normal stress difference allows cross-slope height variations to develop in regions with considerable cross-slope velocity shear, consistent with the experiments. The model also predicts the development of lateral eddies, which are yet to be observed.},

@article{srivastava_viscometric_2021,
	abstract = {, This study examines the flow of dense granular materials under external shear stress and pressure using discrete element method simulations. In this method, the material is allowed to strain along all periodic directions and adapt its solid volume fraction in response to an imbalance between the internal state of stress and the external applied stress. By systematically varying the external shear stress and pressure, the steady rheological response is simulated for: (1) rate-independent quasi-static flow; and (2) rate-dependent inertial flow. The simulated flow is viscometric with non-negligible first and second normal stress differences. While both normal stress differences are negative in inertial flows, the first normal stress difference switches from negative to slightly positive, and second normal stress difference tends to zero in quasi-static flows. The first normal stress difference emerges from a lack of coaxiality between a second-rank contact fabric tensor and strain rate tensor in the flow plane, while the second normal stress difference is linked to an excess of contacts in the shear plane compared with the vorticity direction. A general rheological model of second order (in terms of strain rate tensor) is proposed to describe the two types of flow, and the model is calibrated for various values of interparticle friction from simulations on nearly monodisperse spheres. The model incorporates normal stress differences in both regimes of flow and provides a complete viscometric description of steady dense granular flows.},

	abstract = {A comprehensive review is presented of the physical behavior of yield stress materials in soft condensed matter, which encompasses a broad range of materials from colloidal assemblies and gels to emulsions and non-Brownian suspensions. All these disordered materials display a nonlinear flow behavior in response to external mechanical forces due to the existence of a finite force threshold for flow to occur: the yield stress. Both the physical origin and rheological consequences associated with this nonlinear behavior are discussed and an overview is given of experimental techniques available to measure the yield stress. Recent progress is discussed concerning a microscopic theoretical description of the flow dynamics of yield stress materials, emphasizing, in particular, the role played by relaxation time scales, the interplay between shear flow and aging behavior, the existence of inhomogeneous shear flows and shear bands, wall slip, and nonlocal effects in confined geometries.},

	abstract = {Inhaled particles have been implicated in many forms of respiratory disease. Mathematical lung deposition models have been developed for spheres and fibers, but not for non-spherical, noncylindrical particles because theory and experimental data have been unavailable. To satisfy this need, non-spherical, orthotropic particles settling in air were modeled under dynamically similar conditions using aluminum prisms settling in viscous oil. Twenty-five rectangular prisms, each with a different length: width: thickness ratio, were settled in each of their three primary orientations and the resulting drag forces determined. Linear regression using predictors related to prism geometry and orientation resulted in an empirical drag force equation. Equation drag predictions are in excellent agreement with published data for rectangular prisms and other orthotropic objects including cylinders, ellipsoids, and double-conicals. The equation was validated by settling a quasi-monodisperse aerosol of tungstic acid platelets in a St{\"o}ber spiral centrifuge, and comparing predicted with observed aerodynamic behavior. Using these results, lung deposition models for flakes and other non-spherical particles are now possible.},

@article{mcnown_effects_1950,
	abstract = {Extensive theoretical and experimental studies have been conducted at the Iowa Institute of Hydraulic Research in an investigation of the effect of shape on the settling velocity of particles. A number of representative axisymmetric shapes were used in the experiments, the Reynolds numbers of the particle motion ranging from 10−4 to 10+1. Stability of orientation was also investigated. Analytical results were obtained for the motion of ellipsoids within the Stokes range by solving Oberbeck's integral equation. The ratio of the principal-axis lengths was found to be by far the most significant of the various shape factors which have been proposed. In fact, the settling velocities of particles over a wide range of shape can be estimated within ten per cent from the theoretical results for ellipsoids.},

@article{omand_sinking_2020,
	abstract = {The sinking of organic particles produced in the upper sunlit layers of the ocean forms an important limb of the oceanic biological pump, which impacts the sequestration of carbon and resupply of nutrients in the mesopelagic ocean. Particles raining out from the upper ocean undergo remineralization by bacteria colonized on their surface and interior, leading to an attenuation in the sinking flux of organic matter with depth. Here, we formulate a mechanistic model for the depth-dependent, sinking, particulate mass flux constituted by a range of sinking, remineralizing particles. Like previous studies, we find that the model does not achieve the characteristic `Martin curve' flux profile with a single type of particle, but instead requires a distribution of particle sizes and/or properties. We consider various functional forms of remineralization appropriate for solid/compact particles, and aggregates with an anoxic or oxic interior. We explore the sensitivity of the shape of the flux vs. depth profile to the choice of remineralization function, relative particle density, particle size distribution, and water column density stratification, and find that neither a power-law nor exponential function provides a definitively superior fit to the modeled profiles. The profiles are also sensitive to the time history of the particle source. Varying surface particle size distribution (via the slope of the particle number spectrum) over 3 days to represent a transient phytoplankton bloom results in transient subsurface maxima or pulses in the sinking mass flux. This work contributes to a growing body of mechanistic export flux models that offer scope to incorporate underlying dynamical and biological processes into global carbon cycle models.},

We compare a single- and double-layer integral method to compute the velocity, and we determine that the single-layer approach is more suitable to capturing the flow around aggregates. We then characterize the drag of translation flows, the torque of rotational flows, and the straining force of extensional flows acting on aggregates as a function of their size and mode of formation. We determine that the force and torque are best characterized using the gyration radius of the aggregates, and the straining force is better characterized by the maximal radius.},

Extending the earlier work of Rokhlin, Greengard has developed general, numerically stable methods for evaluating all pairwise interactions in linear time, a great improvement over the quadratic time required by the naive approach, and significantly better than any other proposed alternative.The "Rokhlin-Greengard" algorithm promises to make previously prohibitive simulations feasible, with speedups of three to four orders of magnitude in a system of a million particles. Moreover, the algorithm is well-suited for vector and parallel machines, and should make full use of their capabilities. The author presents his work with great clarity, and demonstrates the superiority of his methods both by mathematical analysis and by the results of numerical experiments."1987 ACM Distinguished Dissertation"},

@article{mammoli_stokes_1999,
	abstract = {The multipole technique has recently received attention in the field of boundary element analysis as a means of reducing the order of data storage and calculation time requirements from O(N2) (iterative solvers) or O(N3) (gaussian elimination) to O(N log N) or O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the discretized system. Such a reduction in the growth of the calculation time and data storage is crucial in applications where N is large, such as when modelling the macroscopic behaviour of suspensions of particles. In such cases, a minimum of 1000 particles is needed to obtain statistically meaningful results, leading to systems with N of the order of 10 000 for the smallest problems. When only boundary velocities are known, the indirect boundary element formulation for Stokes flow results in Fredholm equations of the second kind, which generally produce a well-posed set of equations when discretized, a necessary requirement for iterative solution methods. The direct boundary element formulation, on the other hand, results in Fredholm equations of the first kind, which, upon discretization, produce ill-conditioned systems of equations. The model system here is a two-dimensional wide-gap couette viscometer, where particles are suspended in the fluid between the cylinders. This is a typical system that is efficiently modelled using boundary element method simulations. The multipolar technique is applied to both direct and indirect formulations. It is found that the indirect approach is sufficiently well-conditioned to allow the use of fast multipole methods. The direct approach results in severe ill-conditioning, to a point where application of the multipole method leads to non-convergence of the solution iteration.

@article{yan_kernel_2020,
	abstract = {Many different simulation methods for Stokes flow problems involve a common computationally intense task---the summation of a kernel function over \$O(N{\textasciicircum}2)\$ pairs of points. One popular technique is the Kernel Independent Fast Multipole Method (KIFMM), which constructs a spatial adaptive octree and places a small number of equivalent multipole and local points around each octree box, and completes the kernel sum with \$O(N)\$ performance. However, the KIFMM cannot be used directly with nonlinear kernels, can be inefficient for complicated linear kernels, and in general is difficult to implement compared to less-efficient alternatives such as Ewald-type methods. Here we present the Kernel Aggregated Fast Multipole Method (KAFMM), which overcomes these drawbacks by allowing different kernel functions to be used for specific stages of octree traversal. In many cases a simpler linear kernel suffices during the most extensive stage of octree traversal, even for nonlinear kernel summation problems. The KAFMM thereby improves computational efficiency in general and also allows efficient evaluation of some nonlinear kernel functions such as the regularized Stokeslet. We have implemented our method as an open-source software library STKFMM with support for Laplace kernels, the Stokeslet, regularized Stokeslet, Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa (RPY) tensor, and the Stokes double-layer and traction operators. Open and periodic boundary conditions are supported for all kernels, and the no-slip wall boundary condition is supported for the Stokeslet and RPY tensor. The package is designed to be ready-to-use as well as being readily extensible to additional kernels. Massive parallelism is supported with mixed OpenMP and MPI.},

	abstract = {This paper firstly employs the fast multipole method (FMM) to accelerate the singular boundary method (SBM) solution of the Stokes equation. We present a fast multipole singular boundary method (FMSBM) based on the combination of the SBM and the FMM. The proposed FMSBM scheme reduces CPU operations and memory requirements by one order of magnitude, namely O(N) (where N is the number of boundary nodes). Thus, the strategy overcomes costly expenses of the SBM due to its dense interpolation matrix while keeping its major merits being free of mesh, boundary-only discretization, and high accuracy in the solution of the Stokes equation. The performance of this scheme is tested to a few benchmark problems. Numerical results demonstrate its efficiency, accuracy and applicability. {\copyright} 2017 International Association for Mathematics and Computers in Simulation (IMACS).},

@article{henson_global_2012,
	abstract = {The ocean's biological carbon pump is a key component of the global carbon cycle. Only a small fraction of the carbon fixed by primary production is exported to the deep ocean, yet this flux sets to first order the efficiency with which carbon is sequestered out of further contact with the atmosphere on long time scales. Here we examine global patterns in particle export efficiency (PEeff), the proportion of primary production that is exported from the surface ocean, and transfer efficiency (Teff), the fraction of exported organic matter that reaches the deep ocean. Previous studies have found a positive correlation between Teff and deep ocean calcite fluxes recovered from sediment traps, implying that ballasting by calcium carbonate may play an important role in regulating Teff. An alternative explanation is that this correlation is not causative, as regions where the dominant biomineral phase is calcite tend to be subtropical systems, which are hypothesized to produce sinking aggregates highly resistant to degradation. We attempt to distinguish between these alternative hypotheses on the control of Teff by examining the relationship between Teff and biomineral phases exported from the upper ocean, rather than those collected in deep traps. Global scale estimates derived from satellite data show, in keeping with earlier studies, that PEeff is high at high latitudes and low at low latitudes, but that Teff is low at high latitudes and high at low latitudes. However, in contrast to the relationship observed for deep biomineral fluxes in previous studies, we find that Teff is strongly negatively correlated with opal export flux from the upper ocean, but uncorrelated with calcium carbonate export flux. We hypothesize that the underlying factor governing the spatial patterns observed in Teff is ecosystem function, specifically the degree of recycling occurring in the upper ocean, rather than the availability of calcium carbonate for ballasting.},

The exposition carefully balances solution techniques, mathematical rigor, and significant applications, all illustrated by numerous examples. Extensive exercise sets appear at the end of almost every subsection, and include straightforward computational problems to develop and reinforce new techniques and results, details on theoretical developments and proofs, challenging projects both computational and conceptual, and supplementary material that motivates the student to delve further into the subject. No previous experience with the subject of partial differential equations or Fourier theory is assumed, the main prerequisites being undergraduate calculus, both one- and multi-variable, ordinary differential equations, and basic linear algebra. While the classical topics of separation of variables, Fourier analysis, boundary value problems, Green's functions, and special functions continue to form the core of an introductory course, the inclusion of nonlinear equations, shock wave dynamics, symmetry and similarity, the Maximum Principle, financial models, dispersion and solutions, Huygens' Principle, quantum mechanical systems, and more make this text well attuned to recent developments and trends in this active field of contemporary research. Numerical approximation schemes are an important component of any introductory course, and the text covers the two most basic approaches: finite differences and finite elements.},

A reasonable un- derstanding of the mathematical structure of these equations and their solutions is first required, and Part I of these notes deals with this theory. Part II deals more directly with numerical methods, again with the emphasis on general tools that are of broad use. I have stressed the underlying ideas used in various classes of methods rather than present- ing the most sophisticated methods in great detail. My aim was to provide a sufficient background that students could then approach the current research literature with the necessary tools and understanding. Without the wonders of TeX and LaTeX, these notes would never have been put together. The professional-looking results perhaps obscure the fact that these are indeed lecture notes. Some sections have been reworked several times by now, but others are still preliminary. I can only hope that the errors are. not too blatant.

@article{alldredge_situ_1988,
	abstract = {The settling velocities of undisturbed macroscopic aggregates known as marine snow were measured with SCUBA in surface waters off southern California and analyzed as a function of aggregate size, mass, and density. The mean settling velocity was 74$\pm$39 m d−1 for aggregates ranging from 2.4 to 75 mm in maximum length. Sinking rates in the field varied exponentially with aggregate size and dry weight and were consistently up to four times slower than rates measured in the laboratory. The excess densities of the 80 aggregates examined were calculated from volume and dry weight and ranged over four orders of magnitude with a median of 1.4 × 10−4 g cm−3. Aggregates of marine snow sank more slowly than predicted for either solid or porous spheres of equivalent volume and density, although their velocities were within the range expected for equivalent sinking prolate ellipsoids. No relationships between settling velocity and either excess density or particle shape were found. Drag coefficients of marine snow were also higher than predicted by theory for spheres of equivalent volume and density. These deviations from theoretical expectations may be partially explained by errors in the estimation of the excess densities of aggregates. Variability in the densities of the heterogeneous primary particles comprising marine snow (fecal pellets, clay-mineral particles, phytoplankton, molts, etc.) and the potential for buoyancy regulation by individual phytoplankton cells inhabiting aggregates make determination of excess density especially problematic.},

@article{ying_kernel-independent_2004,
	abstract = {We present a new fast multipole method for particle simulations. The main feature of our algorithm is that it does not require the implementation of multipole expansions of the underlying kernel, and it is based only on kernel evaluations. Instead of using analytic expansions to represent the potential generated by sources inside a box of the hierarchical FMM tree, we use a continuous distribution of an equivalent density on a surface enclosing the box. To find this equivalent density, we match its potential to the potential of the original sources at a surface, in the far field, by solving local Dirichlet-type boundary value problems. The far-field evaluations are sparsified with singular value decomposition in 2D or fast Fourier transforms in 3D. We have tested the new method on the single and double layer operators for the Laplacian, the modified Laplacian, the Stokes, the modified Stokes, the Navier, and the modified Navier operators in two and three dimensions. Our numerical results indicate that our method compares very well with the best known implementations of the analytic FMM method for both the Laplacian and modified Laplacian kernels. Its advantage is the (relative) simplicity of the implementation and its immediate extension to more general kernels.},

@book{kress_linear_2014,
	abstract = {This book combines theory, applications, and numerical methods, and covers each of these fields with the same weight. In order to make the book accessible to mathematicians, physicists, and engineers alike, the author has made it as self-contained as possible, requiring only a solid foundation in differential and integral calculus. The functional analysis which is necessary for an adequate treatment of the theory and the numerical solution of integral equations is developed within the book itself. Problems are included at the end of each chapter. For this third edition in order to make the introduction to the basic functional analytic tools more complete the Hahn--Banach extension theorem and the Banach open mapping theorem are now included in the text. The treatment of boundary value problems in potential theory has been extended by a more complete discussion of integral equations of the first kind in the classical Holder space setting and of both integral equations of the first and second kind in the contemporary Sobolev space setting. In the numerical solution part of the book, the author included a new collocation method for two-dimensional hypersingular boundary integral equations and a collocation method for the three-dimensional Lippmann-Schwinger equation. The final chapter of the book on inverse boundary value problems for the Laplace equation has been largely rewritten with special attention to the trilogy of decomposition, iterative and sampling methodsReviews of earlier editions:"This book is an excellent introductory text for students, scientists, and engineers who want to learn the basic theory of linear integral equations and their numerical solution."(Math. Reviews, 2000)"This is a good introductory text book on linear integral equations. It contains almost all the topics necessary for a student. The presentation of the subject matter is lucid, clear and in the proper modern framework without being too abstract." (ZbMath, 1999)},

@book{guazzelli_physical_2011,
	abstract = {Understanding the behaviour of particles suspended in a fluid has many important applications across a range of fields, including engineering and geophysics. Comprising two main parts, this book begins with the well-developed theory of particles in viscous fluids, i.e. microhydrodynamics, particularly for single- and pair-body dynamics. Part II considers many-body dynamics, covering shear flows and sedimentation, bulk flow properties and collective phenomena. An interlude between the two parts provides the basic statistical techniques needed to employ the results of the first (microscopic) in the second (macroscopic). The authors introduce theoretical, mathematical concepts through concrete examples, making the material accessible to non-mathematicians. They also include some of the many open questions in the field to encourage further study. Consequently, this is an ideal introduction for students and researchers from other disciplines who are approaching suspension dynamics for the first time.},
