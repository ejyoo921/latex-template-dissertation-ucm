With a constitutive rheology code, we can capture such complex continuum hydrodynamics. We thus consider both the shear stress rate and the pressure onto the materials of interest as the sources of the yield stress. 
We use the \href{https://amrex-codes.github.io/index.html}{{\color{blue}AMReX-Codes}}, which is a block-Structured Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) Software Framework and Applications. 
We implement the granular material viscosity computation in \verb+incflo+, which is the AMReX-based module for modeling the variable density incompressible Navier-Stokes equations without subcycling in time.
\begin{itemize}
  \item In Summer 22, I implemented the granular rheology, the viscosity computation, in the  'incflo' module and connect this to solve an incompressible flow model. 
  \item  However, due to the nonlinearity in velocity, we only could use the explicit method, which is the explicit Euler method and was already available.
  \item I implemented an explicit RK 2 method for a higher convergence, but we see some instabilities for certain cases.
  \item Implicit type may be coming. 
  \item For the granular material, the viscosity computation is pressure dependent. 
  \item Connect to the incompressible flow computation 

  
  \item We thus decided to show validation of the RK 2 method with another example. Â 
\end{itemize}
% Further developments included modeling solid boundaries in viscoplastic fluids using embedded boundary methods.

The incompressible flow motion is governed by the law of conservation of mass and momentum,
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial {\bm u}}{\partial t}

  \left(

\section{Normal stress differences}
There has been discoveries regarding impotance of normal stress difference effects in complex fluids. In particular, many works have shown that the second normal stress difference effects are substantial in certain cases. [{\color{blue} REFERNCES}]
% We first introduce a Reiner and Rivlin's stress tensor.
From the following Cauchy stress tensor, 
\begin{equation}
  \bar{\bar{\sigma}} = 
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \sigma_{xx} & \sigma_{xy} & 0 
    \\
    \sigma_{xy} & \sigma_{yy} & 0 
    \\
    0 & 0 & \sigma_{zz},
  \end{bmatrix}
  \label{eq_cauchy_mx}
\end{equation} 
we define the first normal stress difference $N_1$ as 
\begin{equation}
  N_1 = \sigma_{xx} - \sigma_{yy}
\end{equation}
and the second normal stress difference $N_2$,
\begin{equation}
  N_2 = \sigma_{yy} - \sigma_{zz}.
\end{equation}
Unlike a Newtonian fluid, we may observe $\sigma_{xx} \neq \sigma_{yy} \neq \sigma_{zz}$ in behaviors of a non-Newtonian type shear flow.

\section{Granular rheology}
{\color{red}WARNING: NOTATIONS}
\\
In this section, we explain the details of methodology to compute granular flow velocity when external pressure presents. We introduce a stress tensor with a higher-order strain rates that can describe non-isotropic flow effects. A new apparent viscosity computation using the well-known $\mu(I)$ relation can also be found [{\color{blue}REFERENCE}]. With the new deviatoric stress tensor, we solve for incompressible graular flow using incflo. 
\begin{figure}[ht]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{figures/fig_granular_ex.png}
    \end{center}
  \caption{Schematics of granular flow in a box with external pressure.({\color{red}Citation})}
  \label{fig_Laminar_shear}
\end{figure}

To describe a non-isotropic flow, we consider the Cauchy stress tensor, $\bar{\bar{\sigma}}$, up to the second order of strain rate \cite{srivastava_viscometric_2021}. In particular, we see the deviatoric tensor, $\bar{\bar{\sigma}} - P \bar{\bar{I}}$, as 
\begin{align*}
\bar{\bar{\sigma}} - P {\bm I} \equiv
  {\bm {\bm \tau}}
  =  \ \eta_1 {\bm D} 
  + \eta_2  \left[ {\bm D}^2  - \frac{\text{tr}\left({\bm D}^2\right)}{3}{\bm I} \right]
  + \eta_3  \left[ {\bm D}{\bm W} - {\bm W}{\bm D} \right]
  \nonumber \\
  + \frac{\kappa_1}{\dot{\gamma }^2} \bm D 
  + \frac{\kappa_2}{\dot{\gamma }^2}  \left[ {\bm D}^2  
  - \frac{\text{tr}\left({\bm D}^2\right)}{3}{\bm I} \right],
\end{align*}
or equivalently, 
\begin{equation}
  {\bm {\bm \tau}}
  = \left( \eta_1 \dot{\gamma}+ \kappa_1 \right) \frac{1}{\dot{\gamma}} {\bm D}
  \ +  \ 
  \left( \eta_2  \dot{\gamma}^2
  +  \kappa_2 
  \right) \frac{1}{\dot{\gamma}^2}
  \left[ {\bm D}^2  - \frac{\text{tr}\left({\bm D}^2\right)}{3}{\bm I} \right]
  \ + \
  \left( \eta_3 \dot{\gamma}^2 \right)
  \frac{1}{\dot{\gamma}^2}
    \left[ {\bm D}{\bm W} - {\bm W}{\bm D} \right]
\label{eq_2ndOrder_tau}
\end{equation}
where ${\bm D} $ is the shear stress tensor, that is
\[
	{\bm D} = \frac{1}{2}\left( \nabla {\bm u} + \nabla {\bm u}^{T}\right)	
\]
and ${\bm W}$ is a vorticity tensor, defined as 
\[
	{\bm W} = \frac{1}{2}\left( \nabla {\bm u} - \nabla {\bm u}^{T}\right).
\]
We also let $\dot{\gamma} = \left| {\bm D} \right|$, applying the scaled Frobenius norm for a second-order tensor, 
\[
    |\bm{D}| = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}
    \text{tr}\left(\bm{D} \bm{D}^{T} \right)}.
\]
In general, the Frobenius norm states $\bm{D}^H$ instead of $\bm{D}^T$. Since we consider real tensors, it is valid to have $\bm{D}^H = \bm{D}^T$.
We note that the flow functions have the following dependency: $\eta_i(\dot{\gamma}, p)$ and $\kappa_j (p)$, where $i = 1,2,3$ and $j = 1,2$. 
This implies that the terms with $\eta_i$ and $\kappa_j$ coefficients represent rate-dependent and rate-independent contributions, respectively, to the total stress.
Along with the shear effect from $\eta_1$, we can observe the second and first normal-stress difference in shear flows from $\eta_2$ and $\eta_3$, respectively. The rate-independent terms, $\kappa_1$ and $\kappa_2$, allow us to find yield stress. 
\par
We can find $\eta_1$ and $\kappa_1$ terms in equation (\ref{eq_2ndOrder_tau}), using the well-known the stress ratio $\mu(I)$ relationship,
\begin{equation}
    \mu_1(I) = \mu_1^0 + A_1{ I}^{ \alpha_1} =  \frac{(\eta_1 \dot{\gamma} + \kappa_1)}{p},\
\label{eq_muI1}
\end{equation}
where $\mu_1^0, A_1,$ and $\alpha_1$ are fitting parameters. 
Here, $I$ is the inertial number defined as 
\[
  I =  \frac{\dot{\gamma} d }{\sqrt{p/\rho}}.
\]
The inertial number describes the average static force compared to to the inertial force between granular particles. {\color{blue} NEED MORE EXPLANATION REGARDING THE NUMBER I -> PHYSICAL MEANING WITH AN EXAMPLE MAY BE HELPFUL.}
Note that $d$ and $\rho$ are the particle diameter and density, respectively.
By substituting the inertial number $I$ into equation (\ref{eq_muI1}), we get
\begin{equation}
     \mu_1^0 + A_1 {\left(  \frac{\dot{\gamma} a }{\sqrt{p/\rho}}\right) }^{ \alpha_1} =  \frac{(\eta_1 \dot{\gamma} + \kappa_1)}{p}.
\end{equation}
We then find $\eta_1 (\dot{\gamma}, p)$ and $\kappa_1(p)$ as
\begin{equation}
    \eta_1  (\dot{\gamma}, p)= 
    \biggl( A_1 {\left(   d  \sqrt{\rho} \right) }^{ \alpha_1}\biggr) 
     \dot{\gamma}^{\alpha-1} p^{1-\alpha/2}
\label{eq_eta1}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \kappa_1(p) = \mu_1^0 p
\label{eq_kappa1}
\end{equation}
\par
Similarly, we can find the coefficients for the quadratic in ${\bm D}$ terms, having the $\mu(I)$ relationship as follows:
\begin{equation}
    \mu_2(I) = \mu_2^0 + A_2{ I^2}^{ \alpha_1} =  \frac{(\eta_2 \dot{\gamma}^2 + \kappa_2)}{p},\
\label{eq_muI2}
\end{equation}
Then, we obtain $\eta_2 (\dot{\gamma}, p)$ and $\kappa_2(p)$
\begin{equation}
    \eta_2  (\dot{\gamma}, p)= 
    \biggl( A_2 {\left(   d  \sqrt{\rho} \right) }^{ 2\alpha_2}\biggr) 
     {\dot{\gamma}}^{2(\alpha_2-1)} p^{1-\alpha_2}
\label{eq_eta2}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \kappa_1(p) = \mu_2^0 p
\label{eq_kappa2}
\end{equation}
For the last coefficient in equation (\ref{eq_2ndOrder_tau}), we follow the power law, 
\begin{equation}
    \mu_3(I) = -A_3 \left( I^2 \right)^{\alpha_3} = \frac{\eta_3 \dot{\gamma}^2}{p}.
\label{eq_muI3}
\end{equation}
Specifically, we can be find the coefficients of each shear rate term in Equation (\ref{eq_2ndOrder_tau}) as
\begin{equation}
     \eta_3 (\dot{\gamma}, p) = 
    -p A_3 
        \left( \frac{\dot{\gamma} a }{\sqrt{p/\rho}}  \right)^{2\alpha_3} 
        \frac{1}{\dot{\gamma}^2},
\label{eq_gr_eta_3}
\end{equation}
%--------------------------------------------------
We can obtain the flow coefficients from particle-based simulations, such as the discrete element method (DEM). The following numbers are introduced in, Jop 2006 \cite{jop_constitutive_2006}; Srivastava 2021 \cite{srivastava_viscometric_2021}:
    \[
    0.09 \leq \mu_1^0 \leq 0.33, 
    \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 
    0.37 \leq \alpha_1 \leq 0.7
    \]
        \[
    0.01 \leq \mu_2^0 \leq 0.1, 
    \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 
    0.28 \leq \alpha_2 \leq 0.44.
    \]
            \[
    \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 
    0.75 \leq \alpha_3 \leq 0.85.
    \]
     One can find the corresponding $A_i$ values in Srivastava 2021 \cite{srivastava_viscometric_2021}.
\subsection{Computation of pressure-dependent apparent viscosity}
For a granular rheology, it is typical to see compressible flow. It is, thus, essential to take pressure into account to evaluate viscosity.
Here, we consider the pressure as a combination of background flow pressure, $P_0$, that is linear in the vertical direction, and perturbation, $P'$ such that
\[
P = P_0(y) + P'(x,y,z).\]
Note that we can have the purterbations under gravity. Without gravitational force, we may simply input the constant pressure, $P_0$, and keep it over the time.
\par
In case gravity is involved, we consider the density term, in order to approximate the perturbation, as 
\[
\rho  = \rho_0  + \rho'(x,y,z), 
\]
where $\rho_0$ is constant and $\rho'$ is spacial-dependant density perturbation of the flow. 
Here, we assume that 
\begin{equation}
    \nabla P_0  = \frac{d P_0}{d y} \approx \rho_0  g.  
\label{eq_p0_rho0}
\end{equation}
(Note that ${\bm g} = g \hat{j}$
This recovers our momentum equation, dropping the prime notation. As we would like to construct a background pressure that stays over time for our granular rheology, we may use this hidden assumption.
By taking integral both sides of Equation (\ref{eq_p0_rho0}), we obtain
\begin{equation}
    P_0 \approx p_{bg} + \nabla P_0 y.
\end{equation}
We would like to use this form since we already have the $p_{bg}$ term computed in the \verb+incflo+ code (This value is \verb+gp0+).
% We can add $p_{bg}$ as a constant value and the pressure gradient can be found in \verb+incflo+. {\color{blue} what is this exactly? \verb+gp0+ ? \verb+gradp+? or an input? \verb+delp+.}
% {\color{blue} when do we need to use delp?}
When we have a periodic boundary in the gravity direction, we might need to prescribe pressure gradient to have additional pressure effect. 
\par
The main challenge we faced to implement the pressure-dependent viscosity was connecting the pressure in addition to the strain rate into the rheology code.
{\color{blue} Are we keeping this the whole time? Is there any pressure change over time? Does a volume fraction come into play?}

\section{Suspensions rheology}
In this section, we summarize the rheological model of suspensions in a Newtonian fluid. The behaviors of solid particles suspended in a Newtonian fluid can exhibit highly non-Newtonian.  
\par
We use the constitutive equation proposed by Reiner \cite{reiner_mathematical_1945} and Rivlin \cite{rivlin_stress-deformation_1955},  
\begin{equation}
  \bar{\bar{\sigma}} = -P \bar{\bar{I}}
  + 2 \mu {\bm{D}} + 2 \nu_2 {\bm{D}}^2, 
\end{equation}
where $\nu_2$ is the second normal stress difference coefficient. In shear flow, Tanner found
\begin{equation}
  \mu = \mu_0 \ (\text{constant}), 
  \ \ 
  \nu_2 = \frac{\beta}{\sqrt{2 {\bm D} {\bm D}^T}}
\end{equation}

\section{Viscosity regularization}
In the viscosity computations, we presented in sections XX and XX, we encounter a singularity as $\dot{\gamma}$ approaches to zero in viscosity evaluations. 
As AMReX-\verb+incflo+ has the Papanastasiou regularization method implemented, we apply the same method for the new viscosity terms.
\par
By introducing a small parameter, denoted as $\varepsilon$, we can regularize the singularity of $\dot{\gamma}$ as following,
\[
  \frac{1}{\dot{\gamma}} \rightarrow \frac{1-e^{-\dot{\gamma} / \varepsilon}}{\dot{\gamma}}  
\]
for $\dot{\gamma}/\varepsilon \gg 1$. Otherwise, we simply use $1/\varepsilon$. 
The detailed mathematics and analysis can be found in Sverdrup 2018 \cite{sverdrup_highly_2018}
%section3----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Numerical methods}
The main job for this summer project was the implementation of a new stress tensor with higher-order strain rates effect in AMReX-info. The followings are the parts modified in the incflo code: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Add new rheology for granular flows: Compute a pressure-dependent apparent viscosity.
	\item Compute the second-order strain tensor.
	\item Solve for velocity: Implement an efficient method to handle the nonlinear divergence of a new stress tensor.
\end{itemize}
In this section, we briefly cover those three parts.

\subsection{Second-order strain rate stress tensor}
In the AMReX library, the linear shear stress tensor computation is already implemented. For the higher-order term,
\[
  {\bm \tau}_{2} = 
  \tilde{\eta}_2
  \left( {\bm D}^2  - \frac{\text{tr}\left({\bm D}^2\right)}{3}{\bm I} \right)
  + \tilde{\eta_3} 
  \biggl( {\bm{DW}} - {\bm{WD}} \biggr)  
\]
we needed to create a new operator to compute $ {\bm \tau}_{2}$. Moreover, the divergence of it, $\nabla \cdot {\bm \tau}_{2}$, is required to solve for velocity. Note that 
\[
\tilde{\eta_2} =  \eta_2  \dot{\gamma}^2
+  \kappa_2 
\ \ \ \ \ \text{and} \ \ \ \ \ \
\tilde{\eta_3} =    \eta_3 \dot{\gamma}^2 .
\]
We use Mathematica to find the exact component of  ${\bm D}^2 - (\text{tr}({\bm D}^2)/3) {\bm I} = \left[ D_1  \ D_2 \ D_3 \right]$:
\\
First column:
\[
D_1 =
\begin{bmatrix}
   \frac{1}{3} \left(\left(u_y+v_x\right)^2+\left(u_z+w_x\right)^2+8 u_x^2-2 \left(v_z+w_y\right)^2-4 v_y^2-4 w_z^2\right)
   \\
   \left(u_z+w_x\right) \left(v_z+w_y\right)+2 \left(u_x+v_y\right) \left(u_y+v_x\right)
   \\
   \left(u_y+v_x\right) \left(v_z+w_y\right)+2 \left(u_x+w_z\right) \left(u_z+w_x\right)
\end{bmatrix}
\]
Second column:
\[
D_2 = 
\begin{bmatrix}
   \left(u_z+w_x\right) \left(v_z+w_y\right)+2 \left(u_x+v_y\right) \left(u_y+v_x\right)
   \\
   \frac{1}{3} \left(\left(u_y+v_x\right)^2-2 \left(u_z+w_x\right)^2-4 u_x^2+\left(v_z+w_y\right)^2+8 v_y^2-4 w_z^2\right)
   \\
   \left(u_y+v_x\right) \left(u_z+w_x\right)+2 \left(v_y+w_z\right) \left(v_z+w_y\right)
\end{bmatrix}
\]
Third one:
\[
D_3 = 
\begin{bmatrix}
   \left(u_y+v_x\right) \left(v_z+w_y\right)+2 \left(u_x+w_z\right) \left(u_z+w_x\right),
    \\
   \left(u_y+v_x\right) \left(u_z+w_x\right)+2 \left(v_y+w_z\right) \left(v_z+w_y\right),
   \\
   \frac{1}{3} \left(-2 \left(\left(u_y+v_x\right)^2+2 \left(u_x^2+v_y^2\right)\right)+\left(u_z+w_x\right)^2+\left(v_z+w_y\right)^2+8 w_z^2\right)
\end{bmatrix}
\]
We also can write each column of ${\bm{DW}} - {\bm{WD}} = \left[ DW_1 \ DW_2 \ DW_3  \right]$:
\\
First column:
\[
DW_1 = 
\begin{bmatrix}
    2 \left(- u_{y}^2-u_{z}^2  + v_{x}^2 + w_{x}^2\right)
    \\
    -2 \left(u_{z} v_{z}+\left(v_{y}-u_{x}\right) \left(u_{y}-v_{x}\right)-w_{y} w_{x}\right)
    \\
    -2 
    \left(
    u_{y} w_{y}+ \left(w_{z}-u_{x}\right) \left(u_{z}-w_{x}\right)- v_{z} v_{x}
    \right)
\end{bmatrix}
\]
Second column:
\[
DW_1 = 
\begin{bmatrix}
    -2 \left(u_{z} v_{z}+\left(v_{y}-u_{x}\right) \left(u_{y}-v_{x}\right)-w_{y} w_{x}\right)
    \\
    2 \left(- v_{x}^2 - v_{z}^2 +u_{y}^2 + w_{y}^2\right)
    \\
    -2 
    \left(
    -u_{z} u_{y}+ \left(w_{z}-v_{y}\right) \left(v_{z}-w_{y}\right)+ v_{x} w_{x}
    \right)
\end{bmatrix}
\]
Third column:
\[
DW_1 = 
\begin{bmatrix}
   -2 u_{y} w_{y}-2 \left(w_{z}-u_{x}\right) \left(u_{z}-w_{x}\right)+2 v_{z} v_{x}
   \\
   2 u_{z} u_{y}-2 \left(w_{z}-v_{y}\right) \left(v_{z}-w_{y}\right)-2 v_{x} w_{x}
   \\
   2 \left(u_{z}^2+v_{z}^2-w_{y}^2-w_{x}^2\right)
\end{bmatrix}
\]
For now, we compute each stress term separately and assemble when we need to use them. We might want to explore other ways to process these steps more efficiently. 
\subsection{Velocity computation}
For updating velocity, we recall the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. We re-write the momentum equation by splitting the deviatoric stress tensor, ${\bm \tau}$, into two parts, 
\[
 {\bm \tau}= {\bm \tau_1} + {\bm \tau_2},
\] 
where ${\bm \tau_1}$ and ${\bm \tau_2}$ are the linear and quadratic effects in terms of strain rate, ${\bm D}$, of the deviatoric stress tensor, i.e., 
\[
  {\boldsymbol \tau_1} \propto \boldsymbol{D}
  \ \ \ \ \ \text{and}
   \ \ \ \ \ 
{\boldsymbol \tau_2} \propto {\boldsymbol D^2}.
\]
We then have
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial {\bm u}}{\partial t} 
  + {\bm u} \cdot \nabla {\bm u} = \frac{1}{\rho}
  \left( 
    -\nabla p + \nabla \cdot \left( {\bm \tau_1} + {\bm \tau_2} \right)\right) + {\bm g}.
  \label{eq_momentum2}
\end{equation}
{\color{red} The grid system may have changed - viscosity is stored on nodes.}
\\
We use a standard marker-and-cell (MAC) grid; See Figure 
\begin{figure}[ht]
	\begin{center}
	
		\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figures/fig_mac_grid.png}
		\caption{MAC grid cell; Square, triangle, and circle represent cell-face, -corner, and -center, respectively.}
	\label{fig_mac_grid}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
The AMReX-incflo allows us to use either implicit, explicit, or Crank-Nicolson methods to solve for velocity and pressure. Due to our non-linear stress tensor, we were not able to use any implicit-kind methods directly. At the same time, the explicit method shows quite slow computation. We thus splitting the tensor terms into ${\bm \tau_1}$ and
${\bm \tau_2}$ so that we can use a partly implicit method, particularly backward-Euler, with ${\bm \tau_1}$ and consider ${\bm \tau_2}$ as a part of external force. This method seems working, yet more concrete validation should be done. We found that we were not able to have second order which is expected in the backward-Euler method due to the splitting. See Figure \ref{fig_infError_vel}.
\begin{figure}[ht]
	\begin{center}
	
		\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figures/fig_infError_vel.eps}
		\caption{Order convergence plot of the splitting method. We obtain $\infty$-error using to the finest time step solution ($\Delta t = 10^{-4}$).}
	\label{fig_infError_vel}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
To avoid order reduction, we want to use a two-stage explicit method. This work is in progress.
{\color{red} HOW DID YOU OBTAIN THE FIGURE \ref{fig_infError_vel}?}
\section{Explicit Runge-Kutta 2 (RK2) method}
What do you have here?
\section{Predictor-Corrector method}
This is the same idea as the 2-stage Runge-Kutta method. We denote the advection term, ${\bm u} \cdot \nabla {\bm u}$ as ${\bm A}$. 
\\
$<${\bf Predictor}$>$
\\
First, consider the non-linear stress tensor, ${\bm \tau_2}$ as a force term, and solve for the first predictor values, that are ${\bm u}^*$ and ${\bm u}^*$:
\[
\frac{{\color{blue}{\bm u}^*} - {\bm u}^n}{\Delta t} 
+  {\bm A}^{n+1/2} 
=- \frac{1}{\rho}  \biggl(
\frac{\nabla \cdot {\color{blue}{\bm \tau}_1^*} + \nabla \cdot{\bm \tau}_1^n}{2} 
+ \nabla \cdot {\bm \tau}_2^n 
- \nabla p^n
+{\bm g}
\biggr)
\]
We solve for blue terms - 
\[
{\color{blue}{\bm u}^*} +
\frac{1}{\rho} 
\left( 
\frac{\nabla \cdot {\color{blue}{\bm \tau}_1^*}}{2}
\right)
=
{\bm u}^n
- {\bm A}^{n+1/2} \Delta t
- \frac{\Delta t}{\rho} \biggl(
\frac{ \nabla \cdot{\bm \tau}_1^n}{2} 
+ \nabla \cdot {\bm \tau}_2^n 
- \nabla p^n
+{\bm g}
\biggr)
\]
\\
$<${\bf Corrector}$>$
\\
Once we obtain the predictor (star) velocity, we use it to compute the second order stress tensor, ${\bm \tau}_2^*$.
\[
\frac{{\color{red}{\bm u}^{n+1}} - {\bm u}^n}{\Delta t} 
+  {\bm A}^{n+1/2} 
=- \frac{1}{\rho}  \biggl(
\frac{\nabla \cdot {\color{red}{\bm \tau}_1^{n+1}} + \nabla \cdot{\bm \tau}_1^n}{2} 
+ \frac{\nabla \cdot {\bm \tau}_2^{n} + \nabla \cdot {\color{blue}{\bm \tau}_2^*}}{2} 
- \nabla p^n
\biggr)
\]

Now, we need to solve for red - next time step values:
\[
{\color{red}{\bm u}^{n+1}} 
+\frac{1}{\rho} 
\left(
\frac{\nabla \cdot {\color{red}{\bm \tau}_1^{n+1}}}{2}
\right)
=
{\bm u}^n 
 -{\bm A}^{n+1/2} \Delta t
- \frac{\Delta t}{\rho}  \biggl(
\frac{ \nabla \cdot{\bm \tau}_1^n}{2} 
+ \frac{\nabla \cdot {\bm \tau}_2^{n} + \nabla \cdot {\color{blue}{\bm \tau}_2^*}}{2} 
- \nabla p^n
\biggr)
\]
Note that ${\bm \tau}_i^* = {\bm \tau}({\bm u}^*, \eta_i)$.
\section{Validation}
\begin{itemize}
  \item We follow the experiment setup found in \cite{couturier_suspensions_2011}
  \item We want to present the N1 and N2 values with various volume fractions: from 0.1 to 0.5.
  \item the geometry of a tilted trough with rigid spheres in a Newtonian fluid. 
\end{itemize}


\section{Future work}
We propose to extend this work by incorporating elastic effects through the implementation of elastoviscoplastic (EVP) models in this numerical framework. The robustness of the numerical implementation will be extensively tested in various flow scenarios (such as Poiseuille and Couette flows) for a range of Weissenberg and Bingham numbers.  Another potential avenue for development will involve implementing immersed boundary methods (IBM) to model a suspension of solid particles in such complex fluids, which is an important application area that has received significant research interest lately.
