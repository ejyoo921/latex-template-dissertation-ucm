Settling marine aggregates are essential in transporting dissolved carbon dioxide from the surface ocean to the deep sea. While sinking, they may accumulate in thin layers where density stratification is present, becoming nutrient hotspots for bacteria and animal activity. We simulate settling marine aggregates both in an ambient homogeneous and a density-stratified fluid to study their dynamics. 
% We consider both ambient homogeneous and density-stratified fluid.

We model a marine aggregate as a fractal collection of cubes. 
% The homogeneous flow around the aggregate is computed in the limit of zero Reynolds number using a boundary integral method. 
In a homogeneous fluid, the flow is computed in the Stokes regime using a boundary integral method.
We focus on analyzing the forces acting on the aggregate in the presence of various background flows.
We have identified an effective hydrodynamic radius that captures the settling dynamics accurately.
% In the presence of a stratified ambient, a term involving a volume integral is added to the boundary integral formulation. 
% We use the fast multipole method 
% with a modified Laplace's kernel 
% for rapid computation in three dimensions.
We couple the velocity with the advection-diffusion equation to track the heat density or salt concentration in time. We use this method to quantify how the presence of stratification affects the settling speed and time of the aggregates.

We also present the study of complex fluids with higher-order rheology. We introduce rate-dependent flows having non-Newtonian behaviors. 
We pay attention to a flow of granular material, which is the second most commonly used material in industry after water.
We model a second-order stress tensor in strain rate for granular material
% We are interested in a rheological model for granular material that is second-order in strain rate and exhibits yield stress.
% We implement a viscoplastic model 
within an Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) framework, AMReX-incflo, to solve for incompressible flows.
We also formulate a regularization of the yield stress terms to account for viscosity divergence at low strain rates. 
To incorporate a higher-order strain rate tensor with the incompressible solver numerically, we added a two-stage Runge-Kutta scheme in the AMReX-incflo code and the default solver, the explicit Euler method.
