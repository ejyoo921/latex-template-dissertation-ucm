	abstract = {Inhaled particles have been implicated in many forms of respiratory disease. Mathematical lung deposition models have been developed for spheres and fibers, but not for non-spherical, noncylindrical particles because theory and experimental data have been unavailable. To satisfy this need, non-spherical, orthotropic particles settling in air were modeled under dynamically similar conditions using aluminum prisms settling in viscous oil. Twenty-five rectangular prisms, each with a different length: width: thickness ratio, were settled in each of their three primary orientations and the resulting drag forces determined. Linear regression using predictors related to prism geometry and orientation resulted in an empirical drag force equation. Equation drag predictions are in excellent agreement with published data for rectangular prisms and other orthotropic objects including cylinders, ellipsoids, and double-conicals. The equation was validated by settling a quasi-monodisperse aerosol of tungstic acid platelets in a Stöber spiral centrifuge, and comparing predicted with observed aerodynamic behavior. Using these results, lung deposition models for flakes and other non-spherical particles are now possible.},

	abstract = {Integral formulations for the analysis of low Reynolds number flows have been developed over the past 25 years. These formulations can typically be categorized as being either direct or indirect and either velocity integral equations or traction integral equations. Depending on the boundary conditions imposed for a given problem, the resulting integral formulation will result in either a Fredholm integral equation of the first kind, second kind or mixed. In general, Fredholm integral equations of the first kind lead to unstable numerical schemes based upon discretization and can result in low-order accuracy. For most practical problems, the direct velocity integral equation results in a Fredholm equation of the first kind. Nevertheless, many researchers have used this integral formulation with great success and any potential matrix ill-conditioning seems to have little influence on the accuracy of the numerical solutions. In this research, three integral formulations are compared, namely, the direct velocity integral equation, the indirect velocity integral equation, and the direct traction integral equation. Three benchmark problems are chosen for which there are analytic solutions. Although the discretized matrix condition numbers are in some cases orders of magnitude larger for the direct velocity integral formulation, there is little to distinguish between the three methods in terms of accuracy. In fact, the results for the direct velocity integral equation were slightly more accurate in most cases for the three benchmark problems considered in this research.},

	abstract = {Marine snow aggregates are often a dominant component of carbon flux and are sites of high bacterial activity; thus, small-scale changes in the settling behavior of marine snow can affect the vertical locations of carbon export and remineralization in the surface ocean. In this study, we experimentally investigated the sinking velocities of marine snow aggregates formed in roller tanks as they settled through sharp density gradients. We observed between 8 and 10 aggregates in 3 different experiments, each of which displayed delayed settling behavior — that is, a settling velocity minimum — as they crossed the density transitions. Characteristics of delayed settling behavior were also compared to density stratification and aggregate density and size; aggregate settling velocity decreased more, and for longer periods of time, when density gradients were sharper and when aggregates were less dense. The observed relationships between non-dimensional parameters and aggregate settling allow for direct application of our results to the field, providing insight into the conditions under which strong delayed settling behavior is likely to occur. Activities of extracellular enzymes (the initial step in microbial remineralization of organic matter) were more than an order of magnitude higher in the aggregates compared to the surrounding water from which the aggregates were derived. Coupling measured enzyme activities with observations of delayed settling behavior demonstrates that the extent as well as the vertical location of enzyme activity is strongly affected by aggregate settling behavior: total enzyme activity within the region of the density transition increased by a factor of 18 with increasing stratification. This study, which combines direct measurements of small-scale aggregate settling and microbial enzyme activity, offers an opportunity to determine the potential implications of delayed settling behavior for local and larger-scale carbon cycling in the ocean.},

The effect of gravity (thus the local pressure) and the often-neglected contact stiffness are the focus of this study. A series of particle simulations are performed on a weakly frictional granular assembly in a split-bottom geometry considering various magnitudes of gravity and contact stiffnesses. While traditionally the inertial number, i.e., the ratio of stress to strain-rate time scales, is used to describe the flow rheology, we report that a second dimensionless number, the ratio of softness and stress time scales, must also be included to characterize the bulk flow behavior. For slow, quasistatic flows, the density increases while the effective (macroscopic) friction decreases with increase in either particle softness or local pressure. This trend is added to the rheology and can be traced back to the anisotropy in the contact network, displaying a linear correlation between the effective friction coefficient and deviatoric fabric in the steady state. When the external rotation rate is increased towards the inertial regime, for a given gravity field and contact stiffness, the effective friction increases faster than linearly with the deviatoric fabric.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a general class of viscoelastic model is used to investigate numerically the pattern and strength of the secondary flows in rectangular pipes as well as the influence of material parameters on them. To solve the coupled governing equation system, an implicit finite volume method based on the SIMPLEST algorithm, which is applicable for both time-dependent and steady-state flow computations, has been developed and extended for viscoelastic flow computations by applying the decoupled techniques. The main feature of the method is to split the solution process into a series of steps in which the continuity of the flow field is enforced by solving a Poisson's equation for the pressure, and at the end of the steps, both the pressure and velocity fields are made to satisfy one and the same momentum equation. For viscoelastic flow computations, artificial diffusion terms are introduced on both sides of the discretized constitutive equations to improve numerical stability. It is found that there are in total two vortices in each quadrant of the pipe at different aspect ratios (from 1 to 16), and at each ratio the pattern of secondary flows takes the same form for different material parameters, but their strength is very sensitive to the viscoelastic material parameters. Numerical results indicate that the presence of secondary flow strongly depends on the primary flow rate and the elasticity of the fluid, namely, the first and the second normal stress differences as well as their functional departure from the constant multiple viscosity.},

	abstract = {We study the plane shear flow of a dense assembly of dissipative disks using discrete simulation and prescribing the pressure and the shear rate. Those shear states are steady and uniform, and become intermittent in the quasistatic regime. In the limit of rigid grains, the shear state is determined by a single dimensionless number, called the inertial number I, which describes the ratio of inertial to pressure forces. Small values of I correspond to the quasistatic critical state of soil mechanics, while large values of I correspond to the fully collisional regime of kinetic theory. When I increases in the intermediate dense flow regime, we measure an approximately linear decrease of the solid fraction from the maximum packing value, and an approximately linear increase of the effective friction coefficient from the static internal friction value. From those dilatancy and friction laws, we deduce the constitutive law for dense granular flows, with a plastic Coulomb term and a viscous Bagnold term. The mechanical characteristics of the grains (restitution, friction, and elasticity) have a small influence in the dense flow regime. Finally, we show that the evolution of the relative velocity fluctuations and of the contact force anisotropy as a function of I provides a simple explanation of the friction law.},

 is common in 
many environmental and engineering flow situations, yet very little research
 has been 
done to understand the mechanics of particle–stratification interactions.
 To this end, 
a detailed experimental study was carried out to investigate the settling
 of solid 
spherical particles through density interfaces. In these experiments, the
 solid particles 
first descended through a deep homogeneous layer, entered a thick pycnocline
 and then 
descended to another denser homogeneous layer. It was found that the stratification
 
has a significant impact on the settling of particles in the approximate
 parameter 
range 1.5{\textless}Re1{\textless}15, where 
Re1=U1dp/v
 
is the Reynolds number based on the 
particle entry velocity U1 to the stratified layer,
 
dp is the particle diameter and v
 is 
the kinematic viscosity of the fluid. In the above parameter range, the
 particles tend 
to drag lighter fluid from the upper layer into the stratified region,
 thus increasing the drag 
on them substantially and decelerating them within the stratified layer.
 In the Froude number 
Fr1=U1/Ndp
 range 
investigated, 3{\textless}Fr1{\textless}10, where N is the
 
buoyancy frequency of the stratified layer, the drag coefficient was found
 to be an 
order of magnitude larger than its homogeneous-fluid counterpart. The internal-wave
 
contribution to the drag was small compared to that of fluid dragged into
 the stratified 
layer, but substantial internal-wave activity could be detected after the
 fluid dragged 
from the lighter layer (the caudal fluid) detached from the particle.The minimum velocity of the solid particle within the stratified layer
 was found to be given 
by Umin/U1=
5.5×10−2Fr9/101,
 occurring on a 
time scale tmin/
(d2p/v)=
1.4×102Re−1.71, where
 
tmin was measured relative to the time of
 the particle's 
entry into the stratified region. Outside the parameter range 
1.5{\textless}Re1{\textless}15, the drag on the 
sphere in the density-stratified layer could be approximated to that in
 a homogeneous 
fluid, whence the bringing of lighter fluid into the stratified layer as
 a tail behind the 
descending particle was found to be negligible.},

The system is governed by incompressible conservation of mass, the Cauchy momentum equation, and a generalised Newtonian constitutive law. In order to simulate a wide range of viscoplastic fluids, we employ the Herschel-Bulkley model for yield-stress fluids with nonlinear stress-strain dependency above the yield limit. We utilise Papanastasiou regularisation in our algorithm to deal with the singularity in apparent viscosity. The resulting system of partial differential equations is solved using the IAMR (Incompressible Adaptive Mesh Refinement) code, which uses second-order Godunov methodology for the advective terms and semi-implicit diffusion in the context of an approximate projection method to solve adaptively refined meshes. By augmenting the IAMR code with the ability to simulate regularised Herschel-Bulkley fluids, we obtain efficient numerical software for time-dependent viscoplastic flow in three dimensions, which can be used to investigate systems not considered previously due to computational expense. We validate results from simulations using this new capability against previously published data for Bingham plastics and power-law fluids in the two-dimensional lid-driven cavity. In doing so, we expand the range of Bingham and Reynolds numbers which have been considered in the benchmark tests. Moreover, extensions to time-dependent flow of Herschel-Bulkley fluids and three spatial dimensions offer new insights into the flow of viscoplastic fluids in this test case, and we provide missing benchmark results for these extensions.},

The crossover from fragile to elastoplastic behavior is explored.},

	abstract = {Shear flow is ubiquitous. Not only is it arguably the most widely-used deformation type to characterise complex fluids in rheological studies but also, in practice, the deformation most likely to occur in the great majority of flows, e.g. involving fluid transport through pipes or conduits. In steady simple shear flow the rheological properties of a complex fluid are completely characterised in just three material functions; the variation with shear rate of the shear viscosity and the so-called first and second normal-stress differences. Despite requiring only three material functions to be completely characterised, most shear-flow rheological characterisations are usually restricted simply to the shear viscosity and, at best, the variation of the first normal-stress difference N1 with shear rate. The second normal-stress difference N2 remains very much neglected. For dilute polymer solutions where this quantity may be negligibly small in comparison to the first normal-stress difference, such neglect is justified but for a whole range of complex fluids – indeed even polymer solutions outside of the dilute regime and especially melts – it is not clear that N2 may be safely disregarded. Indeed, in this review article we spotlight a number of flows where second normal-stress differences are of importance and potentially major consequence. Following this attention, we review the many experimental techniques which have been proposed for its measurement and survey the available literature for measurements of this quantity for various complex fluids including the aforementioned polymeric solutions, melts, liquid crystals, dense non-Brownian suspensions (both with Newtonian and complex fluid bases), semi-dilute wormlike micellar fluids and magnetorheological fluids. Theoretical predictions for N2 from various commonly-used continuum constitutive equations – primarily from the polymer literature – are also given and their asymptotic predictions at low and high shear rates compared. Finally, we end with a brief summary and outlook.},

This model is applied to the experiments using a shallow water approximation, given that the depth of the flow is much smaller than the width. The model predicts that a second normal stress difference allows cross-slope height variations to develop in regions with considerable cross-slope velocity shear, consistent with the experiments. The model also predicts the development of lateral eddies, which are yet to be observed.},

The appearance of a slip velocity at the wall critically affects wall stresses and flow profiles, and particularly the total flowrate. In this work we show, through numerical simulations and experiments, that the global slip phenomenon at a wall has peculiar features which deviate significantly from simple sliding behavior. At first we present experimental data for the vertical chute flow which highlight that wall slip depends on many operating and system variables such as flow rate, material properties, wall properties. Secondly, we resume a large campaign of numerical data performed in 2D with polygonal particles, and try to analyse the effect of material properties, contact parameters, operating variables, different flow configurations, on the slip phenomenon. The numerical campaign allowed to identify the main parameters affecting the wall slip behavior of a numerical model of granular flow, providing the ingredients for the creation of a framework for the description of wall slip.},

	abstract = {, This study examines the flow of dense granular materials under external shear stress and pressure using discrete element method simulations. In this method, the material is allowed to strain along all periodic directions and adapt its solid volume fraction in response to an imbalance between the internal state of stress and the external applied stress. By systematically varying the external shear stress and pressure, the steady rheological response is simulated for: (1) rate-independent quasi-static flow; and (2) rate-dependent inertial flow. The simulated flow is viscometric with non-negligible first and second normal stress differences. While both normal stress differences are negative in inertial flows, the first normal stress difference switches from negative to slightly positive, and second normal stress difference tends to zero in quasi-static flows. The first normal stress difference emerges from a lack of coaxiality between a second-rank contact fabric tensor and strain rate tensor in the flow plane, while the second normal stress difference is linked to an excess of contacts in the shear plane compared with the vorticity direction. A general rheological model of second order (in terms of strain rate tensor) is proposed to describe the two types of flow, and the model is calibrated for various values of interparticle friction from simulations on nearly monodisperse spheres. The model incorporates normal stress differences in both regimes of flow and provides a complete viscometric description of steady dense granular flows.},

	abstract = {We derive analytically the angular velocity of a spheroid, of an arbitrary aspect ratio \${\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}kappa\$ , sedimenting in a linearly stratified fluid. The analysis demarcates regions in parameter space corresponding to broadside-on and edgewise settling in the limit \$Re, Ri\_v {\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}ll 1\$ , where \$Re = {\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}rho \_0UL/{\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}mu\$ and \$Ri\_v ={\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}gamma L{\textasciicircum}3{\textbackslash}{\textbackslash},g/{\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}mu U\$ , the Reynolds and viscous Richardson numbers, respectively, are dimensionless measures of the importance of inertial and buoyancy forces relative to viscous ones. Here, \$L\$ is the spheroid semi-major axis, \$U\$ an appropriate settling velocity scale, \${\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}mu\$ the fluid viscosity and \${\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}gamma {\textbackslash}{\textbackslash} (\&gt;0)\$ the (constant) density gradient characterizing the stably stratified ambient, with the fluid density \${\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}rho\_0\$ taken to be a constant within the Boussinesq framework. A reciprocal theorem formulation identifies three contributions to the angular velocity: (1) an \$O(Re)\$ inertial contribution that already exists in a homogeneous ambient, and orients the spheroid broadside-on; (2) an \$O(Ri\_v)\$ hydrostatic contribution due to the ambient stratification that also orients the spheroid broadside-on; and (3) a hydrodynamic contribution arising from the perturbation of the ambient stratification whose nature depends on \$Pe\$ ; \$Pe = UL/D\$ being the Péclet number with \$D\$ the diffusivity of the stratifying agent. For \$Pe {\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}ll 1\$ , this contribution is \$O(Ri\_v)\$ and orients prolate spheroids edgewise for all \${\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}kappa {\textbackslash}{\textbackslash} (\&gt;1)\$ . For oblate spheroids, it changes sign across a critical aspect ratio \${\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}kappa \_c {\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}approx 0.41\$ , orienting oblate spheroids with \${\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}kappa \_c \&lt; {\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}kappa \&lt; 1\$ edgewise and those with \${\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}kappa \&lt; {\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}kappa \_c\$ broadside-on. For \$Pe {\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}ll 1\$ , the hydrodynamic component is always smaller in magnitude than the hydrostatic one, so a sedimenting spheroid in this limit always orients broadside-on. For \$Pe {\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}gg 1\$ , the hydrodynamic contribution is dominant, being \$O(Ri\_v{\textasciicircum}\{\{2\}/\{3\}\}\$ ) in the Stokes stratification regime characterized by \$Re {\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}ll Ri\_v{\textasciicircum}\{\{1\}/\{3\}\}\$ , and orients the spheroid edgewise regardless of \${\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}kappa\$ . Consideration of the inertial and large- \$Pe\$ stratification-induced angular velocities leads to two critical curves which separate the broadside-on and edgewise settling regimes in the \$Ri\_v/Re{\textasciicircum}\{\{3\}/\{2\}\}\$ – \${\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}kappa\$ plane, with the region between the curves corresponding to stable intermediate equilibrium orientations. The predictions for large \$Pe\$ are broadly consistent with observations.},

Diatom aggregates were added to a stratified water column, forming layers within which both microbial concentration and extracellular enzyme activity were substantially increased relative to background levels. Importantly, this enhancement of bacterial concentration and activity persisted long after the marine snow aggregates settled through the tank—that is, 10 times longer than the duration of the aggregate layer at the density interface. Thus, these small-scale microbial interactions within aggregate layers leave behind considerable “carbon processing footprints” in the water column that may affect biogeochemical cycles at much larger temporal and spatial scales.},

To find this equivalent density, we match its potential to the potential of the original sources at a surface, in the far field, by solving local Dirichlet-type boundary value problems. The far-field evaluations are sparsified with singular value decomposition in 2D or fast Fourier transforms in 3D. We have tested the new method on the single and double layer operators for the Laplacian, the modified Laplacian, the Stokes, the modified Stokes, the Navier, and the modified Navier operators in two and three dimensions. Our numerical results indicate that our method compares very well with the best known implementations of the analytic FMM method for both the Laplacian and modified Laplacian kernels. Its advantage is the (relative) simplicity of the implementation and its immediate extension to more general kernels.},

	abstract = {Many problems in Stokes flow (and linear elasticity) require the evaluation of vector fields defined in terms of sums involving large numbers of fundamental solutions. In the fluid mechanics setting, these are typically the Stokeslet (the kernel of the single layer potential) or the Stresslet (the kernel of the double layer potential). In this paper, we present a simple and efficient method for the rapid evaluation of such fields, using a decomposition into a small number of Coulombic N-body problems, following an approach similar to that of Fu and Rodin [Y. Fu, G.J. Rodin, Fast solution methods for three-dimensional Stokesian many-particle problems, Commun. Numer. Meth. En. 16 (2000) 145–149]. While any fast summation algorithm for Coulombic interactions can be employed, we present numerical results from a scheme based on the most modern version of the fast multipole method [H. Cheng, L. Greengard, V. Rokhlin, A fast adaptive multipole algorithm in three dimensions, J. Comput. Phys. 155 (1999) 468–498]. This approach should be of value in both the solution of boundary integral equations and multiparticle dynamics.},

	abstract = {We present a combined experimental and numerical investigation of a sphere settling in a linearly stratified fluid at small Reynolds numbers. Using time-lapse photography and numerical modelling, we observed and quantified an increase in drag due to stratification. For a salt stratification, the normalized added drag coefficient scales as Ri 0.51 , where Ri=a 3 N 2 /(νU) is the viscous Richardson number, a the particle radius, U its speed, ν the kinematic fluid viscosity and N the buoyancy frequency. Microscale synthetic schlieren revealed that a settling sphere draws lighter fluid downwards, resulting in a density wake extending tens of particle radii. Analysis of the flow and density fields shows that the added drag results from the buoyancy of the fluid in a region of size (ν/N) 1/2  surrounding the sphere, while the bulk of the wake does not influence drag. A scaling argument is provided to rationalize the observations. The enhanced drag can increase settling times in natural aquatic environments, affecting retention of particles at density interfaces and vertical fluxes of organic matter.},

	abstract = {Settling of non-spherical particles in a stratified fluid exhibits complex dynamics in a low-to-moderate inertia regime. Although this process is involved in a wide variety of phenomena in natural fluid systems, its fundamental mechanisms are still unexplored. Understanding of particle settling in microscale is particularly important to explain challenging problems associated with ecological and biogeochemical processes in the ocean due to the delayed settling of particulate matter at pycnoclines. Here, I explore interactions between disk-shaped particles and a stratified fluid with a density transition. By laboratory experiments, I demonstrate that the settling dynamics of the disk crossing a density transition are tightly coupled with the wake structure evolution, and I observe for the first time in a two-layer ambient configuration a bell-shaped structure that forms on a jet after the wake has detached from the particle. Furthermore, I identify hydrodynamic conditions for the variations of settling velocity and particle orientation instabilities. These findings shed light on particle settling mechanisms necessary to explain dynamics of marine particles such as plankton, faecal pellets, and microplastics and may improve the estimation methods of sedimentation processes in various areas of earth sciences and engineering.},

Comprising two main parts, this book begins with the well-developed theory of particles in viscous fluids, i.e. microhydrodynamics, particularly for single- and pair-body dynamics. Part II considers many-body dynamics, covering shear flows and sedimentation, bulk flow properties and collective phenomena. An interlude between the two parts provides the basic statistical techniques needed to employ the results of the first (microscopic) in the second (macroscopic). The authors introduce theoretical, mathematical concepts through concrete examples, making the material accessible to non-mathematicians. They also include some of the many open questions in the field to encourage further study. Consequently, this is an ideal introduction for students and researchers from other disciplines who are approaching suspension dynamics for the first time.},

	abstract = {Settling of solid particles in a stratified ambient fluid is a process widely encountered in geophysical flows. A set of experiments demonstrating the settling behaviour (the pattern of trajectory, variation of particle orientation, and settling velocity with depth) of thin disks descending through a nonlinear density transition was performed. The results showed complex hydrodynamic interactions between a particle and a liquid causing settling orientation instabilities and unsteady particle descent in low to moderate Reynolds number regime. Five phases of settling were observed: two phases with stable horizontal, one with stable vertical disk position, and two reorientation phases; moreover, two local minima of settling velocity were identified. It was demonstrated that thresholds for local minima and the first reorientation depend on the settling dynamics in an upper layer, stratification conditions, and disk geometry. The comparison of settling behaviour of thin disks varying in diameter revealed that settling dynamics is sensitive to particle geometry mainly in the upper part of density transition with a non-obvious result that the first minimum velocity is smaller for a disk with a larger diameter than for a disk with a smaller diameter. The analysis of settling trajectory showed that two reorientations are accompanied with a horizontal drift, which may be important in the context of interactions between particles settling in a group.},

	abstract = {This book combines theory, applications, and numerical methods, and covers each of these fields with the same weight. In order to make the book accessible to mathematicians, physicists, and engineers alike, the author has made it as self-contained as possible, requiring only a solid foundation in differential and integral calculus. The functional analysis which is necessary for an adequate treatment of the theory and the numerical solution of integral equations is developed within the book itself. Problems are included at the end of each chapter. For this third edition in order to make the introduction to the basic functional analytic tools more complete the Hahn–Banach extension theorem and the Banach open mapping theorem are now included in the text. The treatment of boundary value problems in potential theory has been extended by a more complete discussion of integral equations of the first kind in the classical Holder space setting and of both integral equations of the first and second kind in the contemporary Sobolev space setting. In the numerical solution part of the book, the author included a new collocation method for two-dimensional hypersingular boundary integral equations and a collocation method for the three-dimensional Lippmann-Schwinger equation. The final chapter of the book on inverse boundary value problems for the Laplace equation has been largely rewritten with special attention to the trilogy of decomposition, iterative and sampling methodsReviews of earlier editions:"This book is an excellent introductory text for students, scientists, and engineers who want to learn the basic theory of linear integral equations and their numerical solution."(Math.

Extending the earlier work of Rokhlin, Greengard has developed general, numerically stable methods for evaluating all pairwise interactions in linear time, a great improvement over the quadratic time required by the naive approach, and significantly better than any other proposed alternative.The "Rokhlin-Greengard" algorithm promises to make previously prohibitive simulations feasible, with speedups of three to four orders of magnitude in a system of a million particles. Moreover, the algorithm is well-suited for vector and parallel machines, and should make full use of their capabilities.

	abstract = {The multipole technique has recently received attention in the field of boundary element analysis as a means of reducing the order of data storage and calculation time requirements from O(N2) (iterative solvers) or O(N3) (gaussian elimination) to O(N log N) or O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the discretized system. Such a reduction in the growth of the calculation time and data storage is crucial in applications where N is large, such as when modelling the macroscopic behaviour of suspensions of particles. In such cases, a minimum of 1000 particles is needed to obtain statistically meaningful results, leading to systems with N of the order of 10 000 for the smallest problems. When only boundary velocities are known, the indirect boundary element formulation for Stokes flow results in Fredholm equations of the second kind, which generally produce a well-posed set of equations when discretized, a necessary requirement for iterative solution methods. The direct boundary element formulation, on the other hand, results in Fredholm equations of the first kind, which, upon discretization, produce ill-conditioned systems of equations. The model system here is a two-dimensional wide-gap couette viscometer, where particles are suspended in the fluid between the cylinders. This is a typical system that is efficiently modelled using boundary element method simulations. The multipolar technique is applied to both direct and indirect formulations. It is found that the indirect approach is sufficiently well-conditioned to allow the use of fast multipole methods. The direct approach results in severe ill-conditioning, to a point where application of the multipole method leads to non-convergence of the solution iteration.

	abstract = {Many different simulation methods for Stokes flow problems involve a common computationally intense task---the summation of a kernel function over \$O(N{\textasciicircum}2)\$ pairs of points. One popular technique is the Kernel Independent Fast Multipole Method (KIFMM), which constructs a spatial adaptive octree and places a small number of equivalent multipole and local points around each octree box, and completes the kernel sum with \$O(N)\$ performance. However, the KIFMM cannot be used directly with nonlinear kernels, can be inefficient for complicated linear kernels, and in general is difficult to implement compared to less-efficient alternatives such as Ewald-type methods. Here we present the Kernel Aggregated Fast Multipole Method (KAFMM), which overcomes these drawbacks by allowing different kernel functions to be used for specific stages of octree traversal. In many cases a simpler linear kernel suffices during the most extensive stage of octree traversal, even for nonlinear kernel summation problems. The KAFMM thereby improves computational efficiency in general and also allows efficient evaluation of some nonlinear kernel functions such as the regularized Stokeslet. We have implemented our method as an open-source software library STKFMM with support for Laplace kernels, the Stokeslet, regularized Stokeslet, Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa (RPY) tensor, and the Stokes double-layer and traction operators. Open and periodic boundary conditions are supported for all kernels, and the no-slip wall boundary condition is supported for the Stokeslet and RPY tensor. The package is designed to be ready-to-use as well as being readily extensible to additional kernels. Massive parallelism is supported with mixed OpenMP and MPI.},

We present a fast multipole singular boundary method (FMSBM) based on the combination of the SBM and the FMM. The proposed FMSBM scheme reduces CPU operations and memory requirements by one order of magnitude, namely O(N) (where N is the number of boundary nodes). Thus, the strategy overcomes costly expenses of the SBM due to its dense interpolation matrix while keeping its major merits being free of mesh, boundary-only discretization, and high accuracy in the solution of the Stokes equation. The performance of this scheme is tested to a few benchmark problems. Numerical results demonstrate its efficiency, accuracy and applicability. © 2017 International Association for Mathematics and Computers in Simulation (IMACS).},

	abstract = {The ocean's biological carbon pump is a key component of the global carbon cycle. Only a small fraction of the carbon fixed by primary production is exported to the deep ocean, yet this flux sets to first order the efficiency with which carbon is sequestered out of further contact with the atmosphere on long time scales. Here we examine global patterns in particle export efficiency (PEeff), the proportion of primary production that is exported from the surface ocean, and transfer efficiency (Teff), the fraction of exported organic matter that reaches the deep ocean. Previous studies have found a positive correlation between Teff and deep ocean calcite fluxes recovered from sediment traps, implying that ballasting by calcium carbonate may play an important role in regulating Teff. An alternative explanation is that this correlation is not causative, as regions where the dominant biomineral phase is calcite tend to be subtropical systems, which are hypothesized to produce sinking aggregates highly resistant to degradation. We attempt to distinguish between these alternative hypotheses on the control of Teff by examining the relationship between Teff and biomineral phases exported from the upper ocean, rather than those collected in deep traps. Global scale estimates derived from satellite data show, in keeping with earlier studies, that PEeff is high at high latitudes and low at low latitudes, but that Teff is low at high latitudes and high at low latitudes. However, in contrast to the relationship observed for deep biomineral fluxes in previous studies, we find that Teff is strongly negatively correlated with opal export flux from the upper ocean, but uncorrelated with calcium carbonate export flux. We hypothesize that the underlying factor governing the spatial patterns observed in Teff is ecosystem function, specifically the degree of recycling occurring in the upper ocean, rather than the availability of calcium carbonate for ballasting.},

No previous experience with the subject of partial differential equations or Fourier theory is assumed, the main prerequisites being undergraduate calculus, both one- and multi-variable, ordinary differential equations, and basic linear algebra. While the classical topics of separation of variables, Fourier analysis, boundary value problems, Green's functions, and special functions continue to form the core of an introductory course, the inclusion of nonlinear equations, shock wave dynamics, symmetry and similarity, the Maximum Principle, financial models, dispersion and solutions, Huygens' Principle, quantum mechanical systems, and more make this text well attuned to recent developments and trends in this active field of contemporary research.

A reasonable un­ derstanding of the mathematical structure of these equations and their solutions is first required, and Part I of these notes deals with this theory. Part II deals more directly with numerical methods, again with the emphasis on general tools that are of broad use.

My aim was to provide a sufficient background that students could then approach the current research literature with the necessary tools and understanding.

The mean settling velocity was 74±39 m d−1 for aggregates ranging from 2.4 to 75 mm in maximum length. Sinking rates in the field varied exponentially with aggregate size and dry weight and were consistently up to four times slower than rates measured in the laboratory. The excess densities of the 80 aggregates examined were calculated from volume and dry weight and ranged over four orders of magnitude with a median of 1.4 × 10−4 g cm−3. Aggregates of marine snow sank more slowly than predicted for either solid or porous spheres of equivalent volume and density, although their velocities were within the range expected for equivalent sinking prolate ellipsoids. No relationships between settling velocity and either excess density or particle shape were found. Drag coefficients of marine snow were also higher than predicted by theory for spheres of equivalent volume and density. These deviations from theoretical expectations may be partially explained by errors in the estimation of the excess densities of aggregates. Variability in the densities of the heterogeneous primary particles comprising marine snow (fecal pellets, clay-mineral particles, phytoplankton, molts, etc.) and the potential for buoyancy regulation by individual phytoplankton cells inhabiting aggregates make determination of excess density especially problematic.},

	abstract = {The sinking of organic particles produced in the upper sunlit layers of the ocean forms an important limb of the oceanic biological pump, which impacts the sequestration of carbon and resupply of nutrients in the mesopelagic ocean. Particles raining out from the upper ocean undergo remineralization by bacteria colonized on their surface and interior, leading to an attenuation in the sinking flux of organic matter with depth. Here, we formulate a mechanistic model for the depth-dependent, sinking, particulate mass flux constituted by a range of sinking, remineralizing particles. Like previous studies, we find that the model does not achieve the characteristic ‘Martin curve’ flux profile with a single type of particle, but instead requires a distribution of particle sizes and/or properties. We consider various functional forms of remineralization appropriate for solid/compact particles, and aggregates with an anoxic or oxic interior. We explore the sensitivity of the shape of the flux vs. depth profile to the choice of remineralization function, relative particle density, particle size distribution, and water column density stratification, and find that neither a power-law nor exponential function provides a definitively superior fit to the modeled profiles. The profiles are also sensitive to the time history of the particle source. Varying surface particle size distribution (via the slope of the particle number spectrum) over 3 days to represent a transient phytoplankton bloom results in transient subsurface maxima or pulses in the sinking mass flux. This work contributes to a growing body of mechanistic export flux models that offer scope to incorporate underlying dynamical and biological processes into global carbon cycle models.},

We quantify the delay in settling due to ambient fluid entrainment and lighter internal fluid becoming denser through diffusion as a function of the Reynolds, Péclet, and Darcy numbers, as well as the thickness of the transition layer and the ratio of the density difference between the lower and upper fluid layers to the density difference between the particle and the upper layer. A simple fitting formula is presented to describe the settling time delay as a function of each of those five nondimensional parameters.},

	abstract = {We present a methodology for simulating three-dimensional flow of incompressible viscoplastic fluids modeled by generalized Newtonian rheological equations. It is implemented in a highly efficient framework for massively parallelizable computations on block-structured grids. In this context, geometric features are handled by the embedded boundary approach, which requires specialized treatment only in cells intersecting or adjacent to the boundary. This constitutes the first published implementation of an embedded boundary algorithm for simulating flow of viscoplastic fluids on structured grids. The underlying algorithm employs a two-stage Runge-Kutta method for temporal discretization, in which viscous terms are treated semi-implicitly and projection methods are utilized to enforce the incompressibility constraint. We augment the embedded boundary algorithm to deal with the variable apparent viscosity of the fluids. Since the viscosity depends strongly on the strain rate tensor, special care has been taken to approximate the components of the velocity gradients robustly near boundary cells, both for viscous wall fluxes in cut cells and for updates of apparent viscosity in cells adjacent to them. After performing convergence analysis and validating the code against standard test cases, we present the first ever fully three-dimensional simulations of creeping flow of Bingham plastics around translating objects. Our results shed new light on the flow fields around these objects.},

We test the ability of theoretical predictions to predict the transverse velocity migration of particles in a confined Poiseuille flow according to the viscoelastic constitutive parameters of dilute polymer solutions. First, we carefully characterize the viscoelastic properties of two families of dilute polymer solutions at various concentrations using shear rheometry and capillary breakup experiments. Second, we develop a specific three-dimensional particle tracking velocimetry method to measure with a high accuracy the dynamics of particles focusing in flow for Weissenberg numbers Wi ranging from 10−2 to 10−1 and particle confinement β of 0.1 and 0.2. The results show unambiguously that the migration velocity scales as Wiβ2, as expected theoretically for weakly elastic flows of an Oldroyd-B liquid. We conclude that classic constitutive viscoelastic laws are relevant to predict particle migration in dilute polymer solutions whereas detailed analysis of our results reveals that theoretical models overestimate by a few tenths the efficiency of particle focusing.},

	abstract = {The ocean's biological carbon pump is a key component of the global carbon cycle. Only a small fraction of the carbon fixed by primary production is exported to the deep ocean, yet this flux sets to first order the efficiency with which carbon is sequestered out of further contact with the atmosphere on long time scales. Here we examine global patterns in particle export efficiency (PEeff), the proportion of primary production that is exported from the surface ocean, and transfer efficiency (Teff), the fraction of exported organic matter that reaches the deep ocean. Previous studies have found a positive correlation between Teff and deep ocean calcite fluxes recovered from sediment traps, implying that ballasting by calcium carbonate may play an important role in regulating Teff. An alternative explanation is that this correlation is not causative, as regions where the dominant biomineral phase is calcite tend to be subtropical systems, which are hypothesized to produce sinking aggregates highly resistant to degradation. We attempt to distinguish between these alternative hypotheses on the control of Teff by examining the relationship between Teff and biomineral phases exported from the upper ocean, rather than those collected in deep traps. Global scale estimates derived from satellite data show, in keeping with earlier studies, that PEeff is high at high latitudes and low at low latitudes, but that Teff is low at high latitudes and high at low latitudes. However, in contrast to the relationship observed for deep biomineral fluxes in previous studies, we find that Teff is strongly negatively correlated with opal export flux from the upper ocean, but uncorrelated with calcium carbonate export flux. We hypothesize that the underlying factor governing the spatial patterns observed in Teff is ecosystem function, specifically the degree of recycling occurring in the upper ocean, rather than the availability of calcium carbonate for ballasting.},

	abstract = {The sinking of organic particles produced in the upper sunlit layers of the ocean forms an important limb of the oceanic biological pump, which impacts the sequestration of carbon and resupply of nutrients in the mesopelagic ocean. Particles raining out from the upper ocean undergo remineralization by bacteria colonized on their surface and interior, leading to an attenuation in the sinking flux of organic matter with depth. Here, we formulate a mechanistic model for the depth-dependent, sinking, particulate mass flux constituted by a range of sinking, remineralizing particles. Like previous studies, we find that the model does not achieve the characteristic ‘Martin curve’ flux profile with a single type of particle, but instead requires a distribution of particle sizes and/or properties. We consider various functional forms of remineralization appropriate for solid/compact particles, and aggregates with an anoxic or oxic interior. We explore the sensitivity of the shape of the flux vs. depth profile to the choice of remineralization function, relative particle density, particle size distribution, and water column density stratification, and find that neither a power-law nor exponential function provides a definitively superior fit to the modeled profiles. The profiles are also sensitive to the time history of the particle source. Varying surface particle size distribution (via the slope of the particle number spectrum) over 3 days to represent a transient phytoplankton bloom results in transient subsurface maxima or pulses in the sinking mass flux. This work contributes to a growing body of mechanistic export flux models that offer scope to incorporate underlying dynamical and biological processes into global carbon cycle models.},

To accurately model and design SWRO and thermal desalination systems, a reliable method of estimating the effect of pressure on seawater properties is required. In this work, we present this method and new correlations for seawater thermophysical properties that are valid within the range: t=0–120°C, S=0–120g/kg, and P=0–12MPa. Seawater isothermal compressibility data, available until a salinity of 56g/kg, were used to develop a correlation for compressibility that is extrapolated to 160g/kg. Thermodynamic identities were then used to develop accurate pressure dependent correlations for seawater: density, isobaric expansivity, specific heat capacity, enthalpy, entropy and Gibbs energy. New correlations were proposed for seawater: vapor pressure, thermal conductivity and activity of water. Recent work on seawater surface tension and osmotic coefficient were reviewed. Uncertainty bounds were calculated for each correlation.},

associated with the 22.4 σt density surface. A second thin layer of elevated phytoplankton concentration located at a density discontinuity 1.5 to 2 m above the marine snow layer occurred within a dense diatom bloom
near the surface. At the end of the study period, isopycnals shoaled and the 2 layers merged. More than 80\% of the diatom bloom consisted of Thalassiosira spp. (50 to 59\%), Odontella longicruris (5 to 14\%), Asterionellopsis glacialis,
and Thalassionema nitzschioides. A much higher proportion of O. longicruris occurred in marine snow (about 53\%) than among suspended cells suggesting that this species differentially aggregated. Most zooplankton avoided the mucus-rich
aggregate layer. The layer of marine snow was formed when sinking aggregated diatoms reached neutral buoyancy at the 22.4 isopycnal, probably due to the presence of low salinity mucus resistant to salt exchange in the interstices of the aggregates. Rates
of turbulent kinetic energy dissipation throughout the water column rarely exceeded 10-8 m2 s-3 and aggregates below the thin layer were largely detrital in composition indicating that small-scale shears due to turbulence
did not erode the layer of marine snow. The accumulation of marine snow and phytoplankton in persistent, discrete layers at density discontinuities results in habitat partitioning of the pelagic zone, impacts the distribution and interactions of
planktonic organisms as well as the intensity and location of biological processes in the water column, and helps maintain species diversity.},

	abstract = {Chemosensory movement of bacteria toward the cloud of leaked material around planktonic algae has been suggested as an important aspect of bacterial nutrition in aquatic ecosystems. Inability of bacteria to keep pace with falling algae has been suggested as inhibiting such interactions. The interaction between bacteria and falling particles, including microalgae, is explored with a simulation model of bacterial chemotaxis that incorporates low Reynolds number fluid flow and resulting substrate spatial distributions. Results show that although bacteria cannot maintain a position relative to a falling particle unless the particle is extremely large, such as a marine snow aggregate, chemosensory response does allow them to stay in the high substrate environment of the leaky particle longer than if they did not have it. The ecological significance for bacterial metabolism depends on several factors, including the frequency of contact between algae and bacteria and the relative concentrations of substrate at the cell surface and in the background. Optimal enhancement should occur in eutrophic conditions of large algal cells present in high abundances. Presently available values for the ratio of substrate concentration next to the algal cell relative to that in solution are not large enough to suggest that the microzones around algal cells provide significant enhancement of bacterial nutrition. Chemotaxis should enhance interactions with large marine snow aggregates, both by allowing bacteria to stay for significant periods around them and by enhancing the rates at which bacteria attach to the aggregate surfaces. This enhancement is greater for surfaces in which there is a lower probability of sticking.},

The unknown density of Stokeslets is identical with the surface-stress force and can be obtained numerically by reducing the integral equations to a system of linear algebraic equations. This appears to be an efficient way of determining solutions for several external flows past a particle, since it requires that the matrix of the algebraic system be inverted only once for a given particle.The technique was tested successfully against the analytic solutions for spheroids in uniform and simple shear flows, and was then applied to two problems involving the motion of finite circular cylinders: (i) a cylinder translating parallel to its axis, for which the local stress force distribution and the drag were determined; and (ii) the equivalent axis ratio of a freely suspended cylinder, which was calculated by determining the couple on a stationary cylinder placed symmetrically in two different simple shear flows. The numerical results were found to be consistent with the asymptotic analysis of Cox (1970, 1971) and in excellent agreement with the experiments of Anczurowski \& Mason (1968), but not with those of Harris \& Pittman (1975).},

We show how the latter may be used for the direct solution of mobility problems, and how the surface tractions corresponding to rigid body motion of a particle may be easily found, thus removing the major disadvantages of the second kind formulations. For the numerical examples we also show how Fourier analysis may be applied to non-axisymmetric problems with axisymmetric boundaries to yield one-dimensional Fredholm integral equations of the second kind. As an application we solve the resistance problem with a numerically efficient quadrature collocation method that avoids the complications of element methods and difficulties with the integrations near the kernel singularities.},

	abstract = {A model to predict fractal dimension from sedimentating fractal aggregates has been successfully developed. This model was developed using the settling rate and size data of fractal aggregates. In order to test the validity of the model, a purpose-built settling rig, equipped with lens with magnification of 1200×, which can capture images of particles/flocs down to 2 μm in diameter was used. The performace and technique of the settling rig were validated by comparing the measured settling rates of 30- and 50.7-μm standard particles with their theoretical settling rates calculated using Stokes' law. The measured settling rates were within 10\% agreement with the calculated Stokes' velocities. The settling rates and sizes of the particles/flocs were analyzed using image analysis software called WiT 5.3. The maximum temperature gradient across the settling column was 0.1°C, which effectively eliminated convective currents due to temperature differences in the settling column. A total of 1000 calcium phosphate flocs were anaylzed. Calcium phosphate flocs with fractal dimensions varying from 2.3 to 2.8 were generated via orthokinetic aggregation. Measurements of fractal dimensions, using light scattering, were done simultaneously with the settling experiments and they were found to be constant. The fractal dimensions calculated using the model agreed with those obtained by light scattering to within 12\%.},

The numerical simulations are consistent with the analytical results. The ratio of drag force on fractal flocs and floc size shows a linear relationship with the floc settling velocity when the flow filed around the flocs is Stokes flow. The drag coefficient experienced by flocs is significantly different from the spheres. Moreover, drag forces on flocs formed by DLCCA are larger than flocs formed by DLA, when the flocs are composed of the same primary particles.},

	abstract = {Marine snow is central to the marine carbon cycle, and quantifying its small-scale settling dynamics in different physical environments is essential to understanding its role in biogeochemical cycles. Previous field observations of marine aggregate thin layers associated with sharp density gradients have led to the hypothesis that these layers may be caused by a decrease in aggregate settling speed at density interfaces. Here, we present experimental data on aggregate settling behavior, showing that these particles can dramatically decrease their settling velocity when passing through sharp density transitions. This delayed settling can be caused by 2 potential mechanisms: (1) entrainment of lighter fluid from above as the particle passes through the density gradient, and (2) retention at the transition driven by changes in the density of the particle due to its porosity. The aggregates observed in this study exhibited 2 distinct settling behaviors when passing through the density transition. Quantitatively comparing these different behaviors with predictions from 2 models allow us to infer that the delayed settling of the first group of aggregates was primarily driven by diffusion-limited retention, whereas entrainment of lighter fluid was the dominant mechanism for the second group. Coupled with theory, our experimental results demonstrate that both entrainment and diffusion-limited retention can play an important role in determining particle settling dynamics through density transitions. This study thus provides insight into ways that delayed settling can lead to the formation of aggregate thin layers, important biological hotspots that affect trophic dynamics, and biogeochemical cycling in the ocean.},

Reforming systems, however, generates large amounts of water and CO2. The recovery or separation of CO2, a residual gas component generated in vessels, entails considerable cost and energy consumption. It is necessary to understand the characteristics of the interaction between CO2 and seawater under the conditions experienced by underwater weapon systems to design and optimize a CO2 treatment process for dissolving CO2 in seawater. In this study, numerical analysis was conducted using the derived experimental concentration and MATLAB. The diffusion coefficient was derived as a function of temperature according to the CO2 dissolution time. Experiments on CO2 dissolution in seawater were conducted. The concentration of CO2 according to the reaction pressure and experimental temperature was obtained. The diffusion coefficient between CO2 and seawater was found to be 6.3 × 10−5 cm2/s at 25 °C and 7.24 × 10−5 cm2/s at 32 °C. CO2 concentration could be estimated accurately under vessel operating conditions using the derived CO2 diffusion coefficients. Optimal design of the residual gas treatment process will be possible using the derived seawater–CO2 diffusion coefficients under the actual operating conditions experienced by underwater weapon systems.},

Those in which aggregation proceeds cluster by cluster can be understood qualitatively in terms of a solvable schematic model. The diffusion-limited aggregation or deposition of individual particles to make a large cluster is not as well understood. It is closely related to several irreversible processes in other areas of physics, such as two-fluid displacement in porous materials and the dielectric breakdown of insulators. More generally, disorderly growth mechanisms provide structures having unique properties, many of which can be understood by using simple statistical principles.},

In order to demonstrate that settling velocity models based on impermeable spheres do not accurately relate aggregate size, porosity and settling velocity for highly porous fractal aggregates, we generated fractal aggregates by coagulation of latex microspheres in paddle mixers and analyzed each aggregate individually for its size, porosity, and settling velocity. Settling velocities of these aggregates were on average 4−8.3 times higher than those predicted using either an impermeable sphere model (Stokes' law) or a permeable sphere model that specified aggregate permeability for a homogeneous distribution of particles within an aggregate. Fractal dimensions (D) derived from size−porosity relationships for the three batches of aggregates were 1.78 ± 0.10, 2.19 ± 0.12 and 2.25 ± 0.10. These fractal dimensions were used to predict power law relationships between aggregate size and settling velocity based on Stokes' law. When it was assumed that the the drag coefficient, CD, was constant and fixed at its value of CD = 24/Re for the creeping flow region (Re ≪ 1), predicted slopes of size and settling velocity were in agreement with only the data sets where D {\textgreater} 2. As a result, when D {\textless} 2, aggregate porosities will be overestimated and fractal dimensions will be calculated incorrectly from settling velocity data and Stokes' law.},

	abstract = {The distribution of stresses in rigid fractal-like aggregates moving in a uniform flow field was investigated for particle–cluster and cluster–cluster aggregates with fractal dimensions ranging from 1.7 to 2.3. The method of reflections was used to calculate the drag force on each monomer, while the internal inter-monomer interactions were calculated by applying force and torque balances on each primary particle. The stress distribution was found to be very dissimilar from that of the applied external forces. Although the highest external forces act on the monomers located at the periphery of the aggregate where the drag is more intense, the most stressed inter-monomer bonds are always located in the internal part of the aggregate. This phenomenon is a consequence of the structure of the studied fractal aggregates, which are made mainly of filaments of monomers: the stress generated by the external forces is propagated and progressively accumulated by such filaments up to their roots, which are situated in the inner part of the cluster. Such a behaviour is different from that exhibited by highly connected structures, in which the loads are absorbed locally by the structure and the largest stresses are normally found in the proximity of the highest applied external forces.},

	abstract = {A method has been developed to estimate the motion and the internal stresses induced by a fluid flow on a rigid aggregate. The approach couples Stokesian dynamics and structural mechanics in order to take into account accurately the effect of the complex geometry of the aggregates on hydrodynamic forces and the internal redistribution of stresses. The intrinsic error of the method, due to the low-order truncation of the multipole expansion of the Stokes solution, has been assessed by comparison with the analytical solution for the case of a doublet in a shear flow. In addition, it has been shown that the error becomes smaller as the number of primary particles in the aggregate increases and hence it is expected to be negligible for realistic reproductions of large aggregates. The evaluation of internal forces is performed by an adaptation of the matrix methods of structural mechanics to the geometric features of the aggregates and to the particular stress–strain relationship that occurs at intermonomer contacts. A preliminary investigation on the stress distribution in rigid aggregates and their mode of breakup has been performed by studying the response to an elongational flow of both realistic reproductions of colloidal aggregates (made of several hundreds monomers) and highly simplified structures. A very different behaviour has been evidenced between low-density aggregates with isostatic or weakly hyperstatic structures and compact aggregates with highly hyperstatic configuration. In low-density clusters breakup is caused directly by the failure of the most stressed intermonomer contact, which is typically located in the inner region of the aggregate and hence originates the birth of fragments of similar size. On the contrary, breakup of compact and highly cross-linked clusters is seldom caused by the failure of a single bond. When this happens, it proceeds through the removal of a tiny fragment from the external part of the structure. More commonly, however, breakup takes place through a sequence of bond failures that start at the periphery of the aggregates and then moves toward the interior according to a crack propagation mechanism. A gradual transition between these two modes of breakup has been found as the density of the aggregates increases.},

	abstract = {A three-dimensional boundary-integral algorithm is developed to study the squeezing of a deformable drop through a tight constriction formed by several solid particles rigidly held in space. The drop is freely suspended and driven by a flow that is uniform away from the solid obstacles. Particular emphasis is on the trapping mechanism and flow conditions close to critical, when the drop squeezes with high resistance. The problem is a close prototype of drop–solid interactions for emulsion flow through a granular material; such interactions are much more lubrication-sensitive than drop–drop interactions and require advanced numerical tools to succeed. The algorithm is based on the Hebeker representation for the solid–particle contribution, leading to a well-behaved system of second-kind integral equations, combined with novel regularization techniques for singular and near-singular boundary integrals; high-order near-singularity subtraction for the solid-to-drop double-layer contribution is the most crucial element. Simulations are performed for drop squeezing between (i) two close spheres, (ii) two parallel spheroidal disks, and (iii) three close spheres forming an equilateral triangle (including the case of close solid–solid contact). The drop non-deformed diameter is from two to several times larger than the inner constriction diameter and, in some simulations, the drop decelerates \$10{\textasciicircum}3\$–\$10{\textasciicircum}4\$ times in the throat before being able to pass through. The effects of the constriction type, capillary number, and viscosity ratio on the drop velocity in the throat, exit time, and drop–solid spacing (of the order of 1\% of the particle size) are explored in detail; critical capillary numbers (below which trapping occurs) are accurately determined. Even for a substantially supercritical capillary number, the drop has to nearly coat solid particles to be able to pass through a tight constriction. The ability of the algorithm to simulate both supercritical and subcritical conditions (when the drop is trapped, with a small but non-zero drop–solid spacing) is vital for future applications to large-scale simulations of emulsion flow through granular media.},

	abstract = {The Immersed Boundary (IB) method is a mathematical framework for constructing robust numerical methods to study fluid–structure interaction in problems involving an elastic structure immersed in a viscous fluid. The IB formulation uses an Eulerian representation of the fluid and a Lagrangian representation of the structure. The Lagrangian and Eulerian frames are coupled by integral transforms with delta function kernels. The discretized IB equations use approximations to these transforms with regularized delta function kernels to interpolate the fluid velocity to the structure, and to spread structural forces to the fluid. It is well-known that the conventional IB method can suffer from poor volume conservation since the interpolated Lagrangian velocity field is not generally divergence-free, and so this can cause spurious volume changes. In practice, the lack of volume conservation is especially pronounced for cases where there are large pressure differences across thin structural boundaries. The aim of this paper is to greatly reduce the volume error of the IB method by introducing velocity-interpolation and force-spreading schemes with the properties that the interpolated velocity field in which the structure moves is at least C1 and satisfies a continuous divergence-free condition, and that the force-spreading operator is the adjoint of the velocity-interpolation operator. We confirm through numerical experiments in two and three spatial dimensions that this new IB method is able to achieve substantial improvement in volume conservation compared to other existing IB methods, at the expense of a modest increase in the computational cost. Further, the new method provides smoother Lagrangian forces (tractions) than traditional IB methods. The method presented here is restricted to periodic computational domains. Its generalization to non-periodic domains is important future work.},

We develop a novel approach for generating Brownian displacements that arise in response to the thermal fluctuations in the fluid. Our approach relies on a first-kind boundary integral formulation of a mobility problem in which a random surface velocity is prescribed on the particle surface, with zero mean and covariance proportional to the Green's function for Stokes flow (Stokeslet). This approach yields an algorithm that scales linearly in the number of particles for both deterministic and stochastic dynamics, handles particles of complex shape, achieves high order of accuracy, and can be generalized to three dimensions and other boundary conditions. We show that Brownian displacements generated by our method obey the discrete fluctuation–dissipation balance relation (DFDB). Based on a recently-developed Positively Split Ewald method Fiore et al. (2017) [24], near-field contributions to the Brownian displacements are efficiently approximated by iterative methods in real space, while far-field contributions are rapidly generated by fast Fourier-space methods based on fluctuating hydrodynamics. FBIM provides the key ingredient for time integration of the overdamped Langevin equations for Brownian suspensions of rigid particles. We demonstrate that FBIM obeys DFDB by performing equilibrium BD simulations of suspensions of starfish-shaped bodies using a random finite difference temporal integrator.},

This simplicity carries a degree of cost in computational expense and accuracy because the number of degrees of freedom used to discretise the unknown surface traction is generally significantly higher than that required by boundary element methods. We describe a meshless method based on nearest-neighbour interpolation that significantly reduces the number of degrees of freedom required to discretise the unknown traction, increasing the range of problems that can be practically solved, without excessively complicating the task of the modeller. The nearest-neighbour technique is tested against the classical problem of rigid body motion of a sphere immersed in very viscous fluid, then applied to the more complex biophysical problem of calculating the rotational diffusion timescales of a macromolecular structure modelled by three closely-spaced non-slender rods. A heuristic for finding the required density of force and quadrature points by numerical refinement is suggested. Matlab/GNU Octave code for the key steps of the algorithm is provided, which predominantly use basic linear algebra operations, with a full implementation being provided on github. Compared with the standard Nyström discretisation, more accurate and substantially more efficient results can be obtained by de-refining the force discretisation relative to the quadrature discretisation: a cost reduction of over 10 times with improved accuracy is observed. This improvement comes at minimal additional technical complexity. Future avenues to develop the algorithm are then discussed.},

Coagulation is an important mechanism for controlling the size of marine particles and thereby their transport properties. Coagulation theory has provided a framework for the calculation of aggregation rates and size distributions. The use of fractal scaling to relate aggregate length to mass has been an important development that still needs to be fully incorporated into mathematical expressions for particle collision rates. In addition, disaggregation has emerged as an important process that is poorly described mathematically. Observations of particle spectra in the ocean are in general agreement with those expected for coagulation processes but tend to be for too small a size range to include the effects of particle disaggregation. Analysis of material caught in sediment traps suggests that aggregates are the dominant form of material falling through the ocean. An important aspect of the marine system is the presence of multiple particle sources that can confound fractal scaling based on single source particles. Coupled coagulation and chemical reaction models have become important tools in the interpretation of Th distributions. Further development of coagulation theory to describe marine systems promises to push the limits of our understanding of coagulation processes and their implications.},

This model is validated at limited cases of sintering between two (equally or unequally sized) particles, and chains of particles. The evolution of morphology, surface area and radii of gyration of multiparticle aggregates are elucidated for various sizes and initial fractal dimension. For each of these structures that had been generated by diffusion limited (DLA), cluster–cluster (DLCA), and ballistic particle–cluster agglomeration (BPCA) the surface area evolution is monitored and found to scale differently than that of the radius of gyration (moment of inertia). Expressions are proposed for the evolution of fractal dimension and the surface area of aggregates undergoing viscous sintering. These expressions are important in design of aerosol processes with population balance equations (PBE) and/or fluid dynamic simulations for material synthesis or minimization and even suppression of particle formation.},

We used encounter models based on random walk and advection-diffusion considerations to predict colonization rates from the bacteria's motility patterns (swimming speed, tumbling frequency, and turn angles) and the hydrodynamic environment (stationary versus sinking aggregates). We then experimentally tested the models with 10 strains of bacteria isolated from marine particles: two strains were nonmotile; the rest were swimming at 20 to 60 μm s−1 with different tumbling frequency (0 to 2 s−1). The rates at which these bacteria colonized artificial aggregates (stationary and sinking) largely agreed with model predictions. We report several findings. (i) Motile bacteria rapidly colonize aggregates, whereas nonmotile bacteria do not. (ii) Flow enhances colonization rates. (iii) Tumbling strains colonize aggregates enriched with organic substrates faster than unenriched aggregates, while a nontumbling strain did not. (iv) Once on the aggregates, the bacteria may detach and typical residence time is about 3 h. Thus, there is a rapid exchange between attached and free bacteria. (v) With the motility patterns observed, freely swimming bacteria will encounter an aggregate in {\textless}1 day at typical upper-ocean aggregate concentrations. This is faster than even starving bacteria burn up their reserves, and bacteria may therefore rely solely on aggregates for food. (vi) The net result of colonization and detachment leads to a predicted equilibrium abundance of attached bacteria as a function of aggregate size, which is markedly different from field observations. This discrepancy suggests that inter- and intraspecific interactions among bacteria and between bacteria and their predators may be more important than colonization in governing the population dynamics of bacteria on natural aggregates.},

	abstract = {Aggregates of organic matter (“marine snow”) are highly visible phenomena oceanic waters which can control material fluxes to the deep sea. These aggregates take many forms and undoubtedly have many causes. One form frequently described is that composed of algae, usually diatoms, occurring after an algal bloom. A model combining kinetic coagulation theory and simple algal growth kinetics describes the dynamics of such an algal bloom. Results show this to be a two-state system in which coagulation processes are either unimportant when algal concentrations are low or dominant when they are high, with a rapid transition between the two states. Critical algal concentration for this transition is inversely related to fluid shear, algal size and stickiness, and is similar to values observed after a bloom. The role of coagulation in controlling particle dynamics for more complicated aquatic systems will depend on other biological particle production and consumption processes, such as zooplankton feeding and defecation. These results emphasize the importance of measuring algal sizes and abundances when studying floc formation.},

	abstract = {The vertical distribution of marine snow—aggregated particles {\textgreater}0.5 mm in diameter—was strongly correlated with density discontinuities in the upper 100 m of the water column at 33 stations off central California. Eighty-seven percent of peaks in aggregate abundance were associated with density discontinuities in which N2 (the Brunt-Väisälä frequency) exceeded 1.25 × 10−4 s−2 (N = 6 cph). For 56\% of the peaks, N2 exceeded 2.5 × 10−4 s−2 (N = 9 cph). Absolute abundances of aggregates increased from a mean of 38.7± 18.3 aggregates liter−1 above peaks to 59.3 ± 26.0 aggregates liter−1 within peaks. Accumulations of aggregates could result from sinking into denser water if sinking rates were reduced by at least 20\% due to slow equilibrium of either interstitial water or mucus within the flocs with the surrounding, higher density water. However, our observed increases in σt were insufficient to cause such slowing for flocs whose porosity was 99\% or less; such flocs comprised a significant proportion of aggregates in the observed peaks. However, larger flocs of moderate to high porosity were likely to decelerate as they encountered denser water and could even become neutrally or negatively buoyant for changes in σt such as we observed. Equilibration times of the interstitial water of these generally larger flocs ranged from hundreds of seconds up to 3 h. Results of a random walk simulation of particle motion indicated that turbulence was likely to cause localized accumulations of aggregates and to increase particle aggregation. Because we found subcritical values of the Richardson number (an indicator of turbulent mixing) at the top of regions of peak abundance but not at the base, for 68\% of the peaks observed, we infer that turbulence may contribute to the accumulation of the smaller flocs. Occurrence of strong shear and deviations of temperature and salinity profiles from typical patterns suggest that at least 23\% of these aggregate peaks were associated with horizontal intrusions.},

	abstract = {Huge accumulations of diatom-dominated marine snow (aggregates {\textgreater}0.5 mm in diameter) were observed in a layer approximately 50 cm thick persisting over a 24 h period in a shallow fjord in the San Juan Islands, Washington, USA. The layer was
associated with the 22.4 σt density surface. A second thin layer of elevated phytoplankton concentration located at a density discontinuity 1.5 to 2 m above the marine snow layer occurred within a dense diatom bloom
near the surface. At the end of the study period, isopycnals shoaled and the 2 layers merged. More than 80\% of the diatom bloom consisted of Thalassiosira spp. (50 to 59\%), Odontella longicruris (5 to 14\%), Asterionellopsis glacialis,
and Thalassionema nitzschioides. A much higher proportion of O. longicruris occurred in marine snow (about 53\%) than among suspended cells suggesting that this species differentially aggregated. Most zooplankton avoided the mucus-rich
aggregate layer. The layer of marine snow was formed when sinking aggregated diatoms reached neutral buoyancy at the 22.4 isopycnal, probably due to the presence of low salinity mucus resistant to salt exchange in the interstices of the aggregates. Rates
of turbulent kinetic energy dissipation throughout the water column rarely exceeded 10-8 m2 s-3 and aggregates below the thin layer were largely detrital in composition indicating that small-scale shears due to turbulence
did not erode the layer of marine snow. The accumulation of marine snow and phytoplankton in persistent, discrete layers at density discontinuities results in habitat partitioning of the pelagic zone, impacts the distribution and interactions of
planktonic organisms as well as the intensity and location of biological processes in the water column, and helps maintain species diversity.},

	abstract = {Viscoelastic flows are pervasive in a host of natural and industrial processes, where the emergence of nonlinear and time-dependent dynamics regulates flow resistance, energy consumption, and particulate dispersal. Polymeric stress induced by the advection and stretching of suspended polymers feeds back on the underlying fluid flow, which ultimately dictates the dynamics, instability, and transport properties of viscoelastic fluids. However, direct experimental quantification of the stress field is challenging, and a fundamental understanding of how Lagrangian flow structure regulates the distribution of polymeric stress is lacking. In this work, we show that the topology of the polymeric stress field precisely mirrors the Lagrangian stretching field, where the latter depends solely on flow kinematics. We develop a general analytical expression that directly relates the polymeric stress and stretching in weakly viscoelastic fluids for both nonlinear and unsteady flows, which is also extended to special cases characterized by strong kinematics. Furthermore, numerical simulations reveal a clear correlation between the stress and stretching field topologies for unstable viscoelastic flows across a broad range of geometries. Ultimately, our results establish a connection between the Eulerian stress field and the Lagrangian structure of viscoelastic flows. This work provides a simple framework to determine the topology of polymeric stress directly from readily measurable flow field data and lays the foundation for directly linking the polymeric stress to flow transport properties.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a continuum approach for the blood flow simulation, inside the micro-channel of the few micrometers characteristics dimension, within the context of the finite volume method on unstructured grids. The velocity and pressure fields, for the blood flow, are obtained here by solving the Navier–Stokes equations. A particle transport equation, based on the diffusive flux model, provides the hematocrit distribution (i.e., the red blood cells volume-fraction). The momentum conservation equation for a non-Newtonian fluid model is coupled with the particle transport equation through the constitutive blood viscosity model, and this blood viscosity is dependent on hematocrit and shear rate. The continuum approach for blood flow inside the micro-channel of the length scale of a few micrometers to a few hundred micrometers is expected to break down. Interestingly, the present approach provides meaningful insights into biophysics with less computational cost and shows a good match with the experiments and mesoscale simulation with a maximum average deviation of 11\% even at the characteristic dimensions of 10–300 μm. A correlation is proposed for additional-local shear rate in terms of the hematocrit and the ratio of red blood cells diameter to the channel diameter, which helps us to demonstrate an increase in the accuracy and also eliminates the issues of unphysical hematocrit reported in the earlier studies available in the literature. The study is extended to provide new results inside a square and rectangular cross section micro-channels, under a range of inlet parameters.},

	abstract = {The classical theory of the hydrodynamics of viscous fluids depends on the assumption of a particular law governing the relations between the components of stress in a fluid and those of the strain-velocity. This assumption limits its applicability to Newtonian fluids. Here, the most general possible relations between the stress and strain-velocity components, which can be obeyed by an incompressible, visco-inelastic fluid, are derived. These relations also apply to an incompressible, visco-elastic fluid in a steady state of laminar flow. It is shown how equations of motion and boundary conditions can be obtained if these relations are known. Two problems involving laminar flow are then discussed in some detail. These are: (i) the torsional motion of a cylindrical mass of fluid, produced by means of forces applied to its plane ends, and (ii) the laminar flow of a mass of fluid contained between two coaxial cylinders rotating with different angular velocities. It is found in case (i) that, in general, normal tractions must be applied to the plane surfaces of the fluid, in addition to the azimuthal tractions expected from the classical theory, in order to produce the specified motion. Analogous results are obtained in case (ii). These results apply even when centrifugal forces are neglected and so imply a qualitative difference between the behaviour of fluids in general and those for which the special case of classical hydrodynamics is valid.},

	abstract = {We present the results of measuring the three viscometric functions [the relative viscosity ηr, and the first (N1) and second (N2) normal stress differences] for nominally monosize sphere suspensions in a silicone fluid, which is nominally Newtonian. The measurements of ηr and N1−N2 were made with a parallel-plate rheometer, while we used the open semicircular trough method to give N2 directly. With the trough method measurements of N2 could be made down to a 10\% concentration (φ=0.1); measurements were continued up to 45\% concentration. The trough surface shows visually that N2 is directly proportional to the shear stress τ, and the measurements of N2 agree quite well with the results of Zarraga et al. [J. Rheol. 44, 185–220 (2000)] in the range where concentrations overlap (0.3–0.45) and with those of later investigators. The results for N1 show greater scatter. In the range 0.1≤φ≤0.45, our best estimate of N2/τ is −4.4φ3 and that of N1/τ is −0.8φ3. Hence, the magnitude of N2 is much greater than that of N1. Measurement uncertainties are given in the text—they depend on φ. We have also compared the new experiments with two sets of numerical simulations. There is considerable divergence, which remains to be explained, between some of the simulations and the experiments. However, agreement between experiment and some of the simulations of Bertevas et al. [Rheol. Acta 49, 53–73 (2010)] is reasonable.},

Rotating-rod rheometry is used to characterize the suspension normal stresses which are responsible for a rod-dipping phenomenon. These normal stress differences are seen to strongly increase above a volume fraction of approximately 22 \%. During the course of the experiments, a new time-dependent behaviour is also observed: the dip is filled with increasing times. This time evolution is found to be related to particle migration from regions of high shear rate to regions of low shear rate. The behaviour is compared with the predictions of a suspension balance model in which the particle migration flux is related to the normal stresses of the suspension.},

Recent experiments on granular materials sheared in a cylindrical Couette device revealed a puzzling anomaly, wherein all components of the stress rise nearly exponentially with depth. Here we show, using particle dynamics simulations and imaging experiments, that the stress anomaly arises from a remarkable vortex flow. For the entire range of fill heights explored, we observe a single toroidal vortex that spans the entire Couette cell and whose sense is opposite to the uppermost Taylor vortex in a fluid. We show that the vortex is driven by a combination of shear-induced dilation, a phenomenon that has no analogue in fluids, and gravity flow. Dilatancy is an important feature of granular mechanics, but not adequately incorporated in existing models.},

We numerically characterize the growth dynamics of aggregates and find that their radius of gyration, Rg, grows approximately as Rg ∼ t1.02 for classical DLCA but slows to an approximate growth rate of Rg ∼ t0.71 when diffusivity is size-dependent. We also analyze the fractal structure of the resulting aggregates and find that their fractal dimension, d, decreases from d ≈ 1.8 for classical DLCA to d ≈ 1.7 when size-dependent rotational diffusion is included. The addition of settling effects further reduces the fractal dimension observed to d ≈ 1.6 and appears to result in aggregates with a vertical extent marginally smaller than their horizontal extent.},

	abstract = {The laws governing fluid motion are based on conservation of mass, momentum, and energy. For the Eulerian description of fluid motion, these three conservation laws are coupled nonlinear partial differential equations. However, to produce a potentially solvable set of equations, a constitutive relationship must be specified. For many commonly encountered fluids, the simplest possible Newtonian viscosity law – a linear relationship between the stress and strain-rate tensors involving only two material constants – is appropriate. When supplemented by two thermodynamic relationships, such as caloric and thermal equations of state, the number of equations matches the number of unknown dependent field quantities. Thus, with the specification of appropriate boundary conditions, the overall system of equations can in principle be solved even in noninertial coordinate systems. When the equations of fluid motion are cast in dimensionless form, the dimensionless parameters (or numbers) commonly used to specify fluid flow conditions appear as coefficients of dimensionless terms in the equations. Although analytical solutions to the full set of equations are uncommon, the equations of fluid motion can be simplified, and are easier to solve, under certain circumstances.},
