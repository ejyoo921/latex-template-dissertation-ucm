# Latex Dissertation Template for UC Merced, Applied Mathematics

This template is based on [Lasith Adhikari's template](https://github.com/lasiadhi/UCMerced-PhD-Thesis-Template---LaTeX-) with modifications for my own dissertation.

Fields like `DISSERTATION TITLE`, `AUTHOR`, `YEAR`, ... can be updated in the `dissertation.tex` file. You might also want to update the copyright page in `UCMerced.cls`. 

You can refer to [UCM Thesis and Dissertation Guidelines](https://graduatedivision.ucmerced.edu/sites/graduatedivision.ucmerced.edu/files/documents/PDFs/ucm_thesis_dissertation_manual.pdf) and [UCM Submission](https://graduatedivision.ucmerced.edu/current-students/dissertationthesis-submission) to find updated information on the requirements.
