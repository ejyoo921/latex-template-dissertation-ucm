	abstract = {"The Rapid Evaluation of Potential Fields in Particle Systems" presents a group of algorithms for the computation of the potential and force fields in large-scale systems of particles that are likely to revolutionize a whole class of computer applications in science and engineering.In many areas of scientific computing, from studying the evolution of galaxies, to simulating the behavior of plasmas and fluids, to modeling chemical systems, a numerical scheme is used to follow the trajectories of a collection of particles moving in accordance with Newton's second law of motion in a field generated by the whole ensemble. Extending the earlier work of Rokhlin, Greengard has developed general, numerically stable methods for evaluating all pairwise interactions in linear time, a great improvement over the quadratic time required by the naive approach, and significantly better than any other proposed alternative.The "Rokhlin-Greengard" algorithm promises to make previously prohibitive simulations feasible, with speedups of three to four orders of magnitude in a system of a million particles. Moreover, the algorithm is well-suited for vector and parallel machines, and should make full use of their capabilities. The author presents his work with great clarity, and demonstrates the superiority of his methods both by mathematical analysis and by the results of numerical experiments."1987 ACM Distinguished Dissertation"},

	abstract = {The multipole technique has recently received attention in the field of boundary element analysis as a means of reducing the order of data storage and calculation time requirements from O(N2) (iterative solvers) or O(N3) (gaussian elimination) to O(N log N) or O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the discretized system. Such a reduction in the growth of the calculation time and data storage is crucial in applications where N is large, such as when modelling the macroscopic behaviour of suspensions of particles. In such cases, a minimum of 1000 particles is needed to obtain statistically meaningful results, leading to systems with N of the order of 10 000 for the smallest problems. When only boundary velocities are known, the indirect boundary element formulation for Stokes flow results in Fredholm equations of the second kind, which generally produce a well-posed set of equations when discretized, a necessary requirement for iterative solution methods. The direct boundary element formulation, on the other hand, results in Fredholm equations of the first kind, which, upon discretization, produce ill-conditioned systems of equations. The model system here is a two-dimensional wide-gap couette viscometer, where particles are suspended in the fluid between the cylinders. This is a typical system that is efficiently modelled using boundary element method simulations. The multipolar technique is applied to both direct and indirect formulations. It is found that the indirect approach is sufficiently well-conditioned to allow the use of fast multipole methods. The direct approach results in severe ill-conditioning, to a point where application of the multipole method leads to non-convergence of the solution iteration.

	abstract = {Many different simulation methods for Stokes flow problems involve a common computationally intense task---the summation of a kernel function over \$O(N{\textasciicircum}2)\$ pairs of points. One popular technique is the Kernel Independent Fast Multipole Method (KIFMM), which constructs a spatial adaptive octree and places a small number of equivalent multipole and local points around each octree box, and completes the kernel sum with \$O(N)\$ performance. However, the KIFMM cannot be used directly with nonlinear kernels, can be inefficient for complicated linear kernels, and in general is difficult to implement compared to less-efficient alternatives such as Ewald-type methods. Here we present the Kernel Aggregated Fast Multipole Method (KAFMM), which overcomes these drawbacks by allowing different kernel functions to be used for specific stages of octree traversal. In many cases a simpler linear kernel suffices during the most extensive stage of octree traversal, even for nonlinear kernel summation problems. The KAFMM thereby improves computational efficiency in general and also allows efficient evaluation of some nonlinear kernel functions such as the regularized Stokeslet. We have implemented our method as an open-source software library STKFMM with support for Laplace kernels, the Stokeslet, regularized Stokeslet, Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa (RPY) tensor, and the Stokes double-layer and traction operators. Open and periodic boundary conditions are supported for all kernels, and the no-slip wall boundary condition is supported for the Stokeslet and RPY tensor. The package is designed to be ready-to-use as well as being readily extensible to additional kernels. Massive parallelism is supported with mixed OpenMP and MPI.},

We present a fast multipole singular boundary method (FMSBM) based on the combination of the SBM and the FMM. The proposed FMSBM scheme reduces CPU operations and memory requirements by one order of magnitude, namely O(N) (where N is the number of boundary nodes). Thus, the strategy overcomes costly expenses of the SBM due to its dense interpolation matrix while keeping its major merits being free of mesh, boundary-only discretization, and high accuracy in the solution of the Stokes equation. The performance of this scheme is tested to a few benchmark problems.

	abstract = {The ocean's biological carbon pump is a key component of the global carbon cycle. Only a small fraction of the carbon fixed by primary production is exported to the deep ocean, yet this flux sets to first order the efficiency with which carbon is sequestered out of further contact with the atmosphere on long time scales. Here we examine global patterns in particle export efficiency (PEeff), the proportion of primary production that is exported from the surface ocean, and transfer efficiency (Teff), the fraction of exported organic matter that reaches the deep ocean. Previous studies have found a positive correlation between Teff and deep ocean calcite fluxes recovered from sediment traps, implying that ballasting by calcium carbonate may play an important role in regulating Teff. An alternative explanation is that this correlation is not causative, as regions where the dominant biomineral phase is calcite tend to be subtropical systems, which are hypothesized to produce sinking aggregates highly resistant to degradation. We attempt to distinguish between these alternative hypotheses on the control of Teff by examining the relationship between Teff and biomineral phases exported from the upper ocean, rather than those collected in deep traps. Global scale estimates derived from satellite data show, in keeping with earlier studies, that PEeff is high at high latitudes and low at low latitudes, but that Teff is low at high latitudes and high at low latitudes. However, in contrast to the relationship observed for deep biomineral fluxes in previous studies, we find that Teff is strongly negatively correlated with opal export flux from the upper ocean, but uncorrelated with calcium carbonate export flux. We hypothesize that the underlying factor governing the spatial patterns observed in Teff is ecosystem function, specifically the degree of recycling occurring in the upper ocean, rather than the availability of calcium carbonate for ballasting.},

My aim was to provide a sufficient background that students could then approach the current research literature with the necessary tools and understanding.

The mean settling velocity was 74±39 m d−1 for aggregates ranging from 2.4 to 75 mm in maximum length. Sinking rates in the field varied exponentially with aggregate size and dry weight and were consistently up to four times slower than rates measured in the laboratory. The excess densities of the 80 aggregates examined were calculated from volume and dry weight and ranged over four orders of magnitude with a median of 1.4 × 10−4 g cm−3. Aggregates of marine snow sank more slowly than predicted for either solid or porous spheres of equivalent volume and density, although their velocities were within the range expected for equivalent sinking prolate ellipsoids. No relationships between settling velocity and either excess density or particle shape were found. Drag coefficients of marine snow were also higher than predicted by theory for spheres of equivalent volume and density. These deviations from theoretical expectations may be partially explained by errors in the estimation of the excess densities of aggregates. Variability in the densities of the heterogeneous primary particles comprising marine snow (fecal pellets, clay-mineral particles, phytoplankton, molts, etc.) and the potential for buoyancy regulation by individual phytoplankton cells inhabiting aggregates make determination of excess density especially problematic.},

	abstract = {The fast multipole method is one of the most important algorithms in computing developed in the 20th century. Along with the fast multipole method, the boundary element method (BEM) has also emerged as a powerful method for modeling large-scale problems. BEM models with millions of unknowns on the boundary can now be solved on desktop computers using the fast multipole BEM. This is the first book on the fast multipole BEM, which brings together the classical theories in BEM formulations and the recent development of the fast multipole method. Two- and three-dimensional potential, elastostatic, Stokes flow, and acoustic wave problems are covered, supplemented with exercise problems and computer source codes. Applications in modeling nanocomposite materials, bio-materials, fuel cells, acoustic waves, and image-based simulations are demonstrated to show the potential of the fast multipole BEM. Enables students, researchers, and engineers to learn the BEM and fast multipole method from a single source.},

	abstract = {The sinking of organic particles produced in the upper sunlit layers of the ocean forms an important limb of the oceanic biological pump, which impacts the sequestration of carbon and resupply of nutrients in the mesopelagic ocean. Particles raining out from the upper ocean undergo remineralization by bacteria colonized on their surface and interior, leading to an attenuation in the sinking flux of organic matter with depth. Here, we formulate a mechanistic model for the depth-dependent, sinking, particulate mass flux constituted by a range of sinking, remineralizing particles. Like previous studies, we find that the model does not achieve the characteristic ‘Martin curve’ flux profile with a single type of particle, but instead requires a distribution of particle sizes and/or properties. We consider various functional forms of remineralization appropriate for solid/compact particles, and aggregates with an anoxic or oxic interior. We explore the sensitivity of the shape of the flux vs. depth profile to the choice of remineralization function, relative particle density, particle size distribution, and water column density stratification, and find that neither a power-law nor exponential function provides a definitively superior fit to the modeled profiles. The profiles are also sensitive to the time history of the particle source. Varying surface particle size distribution (via the slope of the particle number spectrum) over 3 days to represent a transient phytoplankton bloom results in transient subsurface maxima or pulses in the sinking mass flux. This work contributes to a growing body of mechanistic export flux models that offer scope to incorporate underlying dynamical and biological processes into global carbon cycle models.},

Analytical results were obtained for the motion of ellipsoids within the Stokes range by solving Oberbeck's integral equation. The ratio of the principal-axis lengths was found to be by far the most significant of the various shape factors which have been proposed.

	abstract = {Inhaled particles have been implicated in many forms of respiratory disease. Mathematical lung deposition models have been developed for spheres and fibers, but not for non-spherical, noncylindrical particles because theory and experimental data have been unavailable. To satisfy this need, non-spherical, orthotropic particles settling in air were modeled under dynamically similar conditions using aluminum prisms settling in viscous oil. Twenty-five rectangular prisms, each with a different length: width: thickness ratio, were settled in each of their three primary orientations and the resulting drag forces determined. Linear regression using predictors related to prism geometry and orientation resulted in an empirical drag force equation. Equation drag predictions are in excellent agreement with published data for rectangular prisms and other orthotropic objects including cylinders, ellipsoids, and double-conicals. The equation was validated by settling a quasi-monodisperse aerosol of tungstic acid platelets in a Stöber spiral centrifuge, and comparing predicted with observed aerodynamic behavior. Using these results, lung deposition models for flakes and other non-spherical particles are now possible.},

To accurately model and design SWRO and thermal desalination systems, a reliable method of estimating the effect of pressure on seawater properties is required. In this work, we present this method and new correlations for seawater thermophysical properties that are valid within the range: t=0–120°C, S=0–120g/kg, and P=0–12MPa. Seawater isothermal compressibility data, available until a salinity of 56g/kg, were used to develop a correlation for compressibility that is extrapolated to 160g/kg. Thermodynamic identities were then used to develop accurate pressure dependent correlations for seawater: density, isobaric expansivity, specific heat capacity, enthalpy, entropy and Gibbs energy. New correlations were proposed for seawater: vapor pressure, thermal conductivity and activity of water. Recent work on seawater surface tension and osmotic coefficient were reviewed. Uncertainty bounds were calculated for each correlation.},

	abstract = {The ocean's biological carbon pump is a key component of the global carbon cycle. Only a small fraction of the carbon fixed by primary production is exported to the deep ocean, yet this flux sets to first order the efficiency with which carbon is sequestered out of further contact with the atmosphere on long time scales. Here we examine global patterns in particle export efficiency (PEeff), the proportion of primary production that is exported from the surface ocean, and transfer efficiency (Teff), the fraction of exported organic matter that reaches the deep ocean. Previous studies have found a positive correlation between Teff and deep ocean calcite fluxes recovered from sediment traps, implying that ballasting by calcium carbonate may play an important role in regulating Teff. An alternative explanation is that this correlation is not causative, as regions where the dominant biomineral phase is calcite tend to be subtropical systems, which are hypothesized to produce sinking aggregates highly resistant to degradation. We attempt to distinguish between these alternative hypotheses on the control of Teff by examining the relationship between Teff and biomineral phases exported from the upper ocean, rather than those collected in deep traps. Global scale estimates derived from satellite data show, in keeping with earlier studies, that PEeff is high at high latitudes and low at low latitudes, but that Teff is low at high latitudes and high at low latitudes. However, in contrast to the relationship observed for deep biomineral fluxes in previous studies, we find that Teff is strongly negatively correlated with opal export flux from the upper ocean, but uncorrelated with calcium carbonate export flux. We hypothesize that the underlying factor governing the spatial patterns observed in Teff is ecosystem function, specifically the degree of recycling occurring in the upper ocean, rather than the availability of calcium carbonate for ballasting.},

The numerical simulations accurately capture the particle retention time.

We compare a single- and double-layer integral method to compute the velocity, and we determine that the single-layer approach is more suitable to capturing the flow around aggregates. We then characterize the drag of translation flows, the torque of rotational flows, and the straining force of extensional flows acting on aggregates as a function of their size and mode of formation.

	abstract = {Integral formulations for the analysis of low Reynolds number flows have been developed over the past 25 years. These formulations can typically be categorized as being either direct or indirect and either velocity integral equations or traction integral equations. Depending on the boundary conditions imposed for a given problem, the resulting integral formulation will result in either a Fredholm integral equation of the first kind, second kind or mixed. In general, Fredholm integral equations of the first kind lead to unstable numerical schemes based upon discretization and can result in low-order accuracy. For most practical problems, the direct velocity integral equation results in a Fredholm equation of the first kind. Nevertheless, many researchers have used this integral formulation with great success and any potential matrix ill-conditioning seems to have little influence on the accuracy of the numerical solutions. In this research, three integral formulations are compared, namely, the direct velocity integral equation, the indirect velocity integral equation, and the direct traction integral equation. Three benchmark problems are chosen for which there are analytic solutions. Although the discretized matrix condition numbers are in some cases orders of magnitude larger for the direct velocity integral formulation, there is little to distinguish between the three methods in terms of accuracy. In fact, the results for the direct velocity integral equation were slightly more accurate in most cases for the three benchmark problems considered in this research.},

	abstract = {Marine snow aggregates are often a dominant component of carbon flux and are sites of high bacterial activity; thus, small-scale changes in the settling behavior of marine snow can affect the vertical locations of carbon export and remineralization in the surface ocean. In this study, we experimentally investigated the sinking velocities of marine snow aggregates formed in roller tanks as they settled through sharp density gradients. We observed between 8 and 10 aggregates in 3 different experiments, each of which displayed delayed settling behavior — that is, a settling velocity minimum — as they crossed the density transitions. Characteristics of delayed settling behavior were also compared to density stratification and aggregate density and size; aggregate settling velocity decreased more, and for longer periods of time, when density gradients were sharper and when aggregates were less dense. The observed relationships between non-dimensional parameters and aggregate settling allow for direct application of our results to the field, providing insight into the conditions under which strong delayed settling behavior is likely to occur. Activities of extracellular enzymes (the initial step in microbial remineralization of organic matter) were more than an order of magnitude higher in the aggregates compared to the surrounding water from which the aggregates were derived. Coupling measured enzyme activities with observations of delayed settling behavior demonstrates that the extent as well as the vertical location of enzyme activity is strongly affected by aggregate settling behavior: total enzyme activity within the region of the density transition increased by a factor of 18 with increasing stratification. This study, which combines direct measurements of small-scale aggregate settling and microbial enzyme activity, offers an opportunity to determine the potential implications of delayed settling behavior for local and larger-scale carbon cycling in the ocean.},

	abstract = {Gravitational settling of dense particles through density interfaces
 is common in 
many environmental and engineering flow situations, yet very little research
 has been 
done to understand the mechanics of particle–stratification interactions.
 To this end, 
a detailed experimental study was carried out to investigate the settling
 of solid 
spherical particles through density interfaces. In these experiments, the
 solid particles 
first descended through a deep homogeneous layer, entered a thick pycnocline
 and then 
descended to another denser homogeneous layer. It was found that the stratification
 
has a significant impact on the settling of particles in the approximate
 parameter 
range 1.5{\textless}Re1{\textless}15, where 
Re1=U1dp/v
 
is the Reynolds number based on the 
particle entry velocity U1 to the stratified layer,
 
dp is the particle diameter and v
 is 
the kinematic viscosity of the fluid. In the above parameter range, the
 particles tend 
to drag lighter fluid from the upper layer into the stratified region,
 thus increasing the drag 
on them substantially and decelerating them within the stratified layer.
 In the Froude number 
Fr1=U1/Ndp
 range 
investigated, 3{\textless}Fr1{\textless}10, where N is the
 
buoyancy frequency of the stratified layer, the drag coefficient was found
 to be an 
order of magnitude larger than its homogeneous-fluid counterpart. The internal-wave
 
contribution to the drag was small compared to that of fluid dragged into
 the stratified 
layer, but substantial internal-wave activity could be detected after the
 fluid dragged 
from the lighter layer (the caudal fluid) detached from the particle.The minimum velocity of the solid particle within the stratified layer
 was found to be given 
by Umin/U1=
5.5×10−2Fr9/101,
 occurring on a 
time scale tmin/
(d2p/v)=
1.4×102Re−1.71, where
 
tmin was measured relative to the time of
 the particle's 
entry into the stratified region. Outside the parameter range 
1.5{\textless}Re1{\textless}15, the drag on the 
sphere in the density-stratified layer could be approximated to that in
 a homogeneous 
fluid, whence the bringing of lighter fluid into the stratified layer as
 a tail behind the 
descending particle was found to be negligible.},

	abstract = {We derive analytically the angular velocity of a spheroid, of an arbitrary aspect ratio \${\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}kappa\$ , sedimenting in a linearly stratified fluid. The analysis demarcates regions in parameter space corresponding to broadside-on and edgewise settling in the limit \$Re, Ri\_v {\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}ll 1\$ , where \$Re = {\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}rho \_0UL/{\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}mu\$ and \$Ri\_v ={\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}gamma L{\textasciicircum}3{\textbackslash}{\textbackslash},g/{\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}mu U\$ , the Reynolds and viscous Richardson numbers, respectively, are dimensionless measures of the importance of inertial and buoyancy forces relative to viscous ones. Here, \$L\$ is the spheroid semi-major axis, \$U\$ an appropriate settling velocity scale, \${\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}mu\$ the fluid viscosity and \${\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}gamma {\textbackslash}{\textbackslash} (\&gt;0)\$ the (constant) density gradient characterizing the stably stratified ambient, with the fluid density \${\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}rho\_0\$ taken to be a constant within the Boussinesq framework. A reciprocal theorem formulation identifies three contributions to the angular velocity: (1) an \$O(Re)\$ inertial contribution that already exists in a homogeneous ambient, and orients the spheroid broadside-on; (2) an \$O(Ri\_v)\$ hydrostatic contribution due to the ambient stratification that also orients the spheroid broadside-on; and (3) a hydrodynamic contribution arising from the perturbation of the ambient stratification whose nature depends on \$Pe\$ ; \$Pe = UL/D\$ being the Péclet number with \$D\$ the diffusivity of the stratifying agent. For \$Pe {\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}ll 1\$ , this contribution is \$O(Ri\_v)\$ and orients prolate spheroids edgewise for all \${\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}kappa {\textbackslash}{\textbackslash} (\&gt;1)\$ . For oblate spheroids, it changes sign across a critical aspect ratio \${\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}kappa \_c {\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}approx 0.41\$ , orienting oblate spheroids with \${\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}kappa \_c \&lt; {\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}kappa \&lt; 1\$ edgewise and those with \${\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}kappa \&lt; {\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}kappa \_c\$ broadside-on. For \$Pe {\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}ll 1\$ , the hydrodynamic component is always smaller in magnitude than the hydrostatic one, so a sedimenting spheroid in this limit always orients broadside-on. For \$Pe {\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}gg 1\$ , the hydrodynamic contribution is dominant, being \$O(Ri\_v{\textasciicircum}\{\{2\}/\{3\}\}\$ ) in the Stokes stratification regime characterized by \$Re {\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}ll Ri\_v{\textasciicircum}\{\{1\}/\{3\}\}\$ , and orients the spheroid edgewise regardless of \${\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}kappa\$ . Consideration of the inertial and large- \$Pe\$ stratification-induced angular velocities leads to two critical curves which separate the broadside-on and edgewise settling regimes in the \$Ri\_v/Re{\textasciicircum}\{\{3\}/\{2\}\}\$ – \${\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}kappa\$ plane, with the region between the curves corresponding to stable intermediate equilibrium orientations. The predictions for large \$Pe\$ are broadly consistent with observations.},

In this study, we used laboratory experiments to investigate how aggregate thin layers, such as those commonly found in the coastal ocean, affect the distribution of bacteria and their activity. Diatom aggregates were added to a stratified water column, forming layers within which both microbial concentration and extracellular enzyme activity were substantially increased relative to background levels. Importantly, this enhancement of bacterial concentration and activity persisted long after the marine snow aggregates settled through the tank—that is, 10 times longer than the duration of the aggregate layer at the density interface. Thus, these small-scale microbial interactions within aggregate layers leave behind considerable “carbon processing footprints” in the water column that may affect biogeochemical cycles at much larger temporal and spatial scales.},

For both classes, we derive general expressions for the modified resistance tensors in the presence of stratification. We demonstrate the application of our results by considering some specific examples of particles settling in a direction parallel to the density gradient by considering both the limits of high (                                                                 \$Pe{\textbackslash}gg 1\$

The main feature of our algorithm is that it does not require the implementation of multipole expansions of the underlying kernel, and it is based only on kernel evaluations. Instead of using analytic expansions to represent the potential generated by sources inside a box of the hierarchical FMM tree, we use a continuous distribution of an equivalent density on a surface enclosing the box. To find this equivalent density, we match its potential to the potential of the original sources at a surface, in the far field, by solving local Dirichlet-type boundary value problems. The far-field evaluations are sparsified with singular value decomposition in 2D or fast Fourier transforms in 3D. We have tested the new method on the single and double layer operators for the Laplacian, the modified Laplacian, the Stokes, the modified Stokes, the Navier, and the modified Navier operators in two and three dimensions. Our numerical results indicate that our method compares very well with the best known implementations of the analytic FMM method for both the Laplacian and modified Laplacian kernels. Its advantage is the (relative) simplicity of the implementation and its immediate extension to more general kernels.},

	abstract = {We present a combined experimental and numerical investigation of a sphere settling in a linearly stratified fluid at small Reynolds numbers. Using time-lapse photography and numerical modelling, we observed and quantified an increase in drag due to stratification. For a salt stratification, the normalized added drag coefficient scales as Ri 0.51 , where Ri=a 3 N 2 /(νU) is the viscous Richardson number, a the particle radius, U its speed, ν the kinematic fluid viscosity and N the buoyancy frequency. Microscale synthetic schlieren revealed that a settling sphere draws lighter fluid downwards, resulting in a density wake extending tens of particle radii. Analysis of the flow and density fields shows that the added drag results from the buoyancy of the fluid in a region of size (ν/N) 1/2  surrounding the sphere, while the bulk of the wake does not influence drag. A scaling argument is provided to rationalize the observations. The enhanced drag can increase settling times in natural aquatic environments, affecting retention of particles at density interfaces and vertical fluxes of organic matter.},

	abstract = {Settling of non-spherical particles in a stratified fluid exhibits complex dynamics in a low-to-moderate inertia regime. Although this process is involved in a wide variety of phenomena in natural fluid systems, its fundamental mechanisms are still unexplored. Understanding of particle settling in microscale is particularly important to explain challenging problems associated with ecological and biogeochemical processes in the ocean due to the delayed settling of particulate matter at pycnoclines. Here, I explore interactions between disk-shaped particles and a stratified fluid with a density transition. By laboratory experiments, I demonstrate that the settling dynamics of the disk crossing a density transition are tightly coupled with the wake structure evolution, and I observe for the first time in a two-layer ambient configuration a bell-shaped structure that forms on a jet after the wake has detached from the particle. Furthermore, I identify hydrodynamic conditions for the variations of settling velocity and particle orientation instabilities. These findings shed light on particle settling mechanisms necessary to explain dynamics of marine particles such as plankton, faecal pellets, and microplastics and may improve the estimation methods of sedimentation processes in various areas of earth sciences and engineering.},

Comprising two main parts, this book begins with the well-developed theory of particles in viscous fluids, i.e. microhydrodynamics, particularly for single- and pair-body dynamics. Part II considers many-body dynamics, covering shear flows and sedimentation, bulk flow properties and collective phenomena. An interlude between the two parts provides the basic statistical techniques needed to employ the results of the first (microscopic) in the second (macroscopic). The authors introduce theoretical, mathematical concepts through concrete examples, making the material accessible to non-mathematicians. They also include some of the many open questions in the field to encourage further study. Consequently, this is an ideal introduction for students and researchers from other disciplines who are approaching suspension dynamics for the first time.},

	abstract = {Settling of solid particles in a stratified ambient fluid is a process widely encountered in geophysical flows. A set of experiments demonstrating the settling behaviour (the pattern of trajectory, variation of particle orientation, and settling velocity with depth) of thin disks descending through a nonlinear density transition was performed. The results showed complex hydrodynamic interactions between a particle and a liquid causing settling orientation instabilities and unsteady particle descent in low to moderate Reynolds number regime. Five phases of settling were observed: two phases with stable horizontal, one with stable vertical disk position, and two reorientation phases; moreover, two local minima of settling velocity were identified. It was demonstrated that thresholds for local minima and the first reorientation depend on the settling dynamics in an upper layer, stratification conditions, and disk geometry. The comparison of settling behaviour of thin disks varying in diameter revealed that settling dynamics is sensitive to particle geometry mainly in the upper part of density transition with a non-obvious result that the first minimum velocity is smaller for a disk with a larger diameter than for a disk with a smaller diameter. The analysis of settling trajectory showed that two reorientations are accompanied with a horizontal drift, which may be important in the context of interactions between particles settling in a group.},

	abstract = {This book combines theory, applications, and numerical methods, and covers each of these fields with the same weight. In order to make the book accessible to mathematicians, physicists, and engineers alike, the author has made it as self-contained as possible, requiring only a solid foundation in differential and integral calculus. The functional analysis which is necessary for an adequate treatment of the theory and the numerical solution of integral equations is developed within the book itself. Problems are included at the end of each chapter. For this third edition in order to make the introduction to the basic functional analytic tools more complete the Hahn–Banach extension theorem and the Banach open mapping theorem are now included in the text. The treatment of boundary value problems in potential theory has been extended by a more complete discussion of integral equations of the first kind in the classical Holder space setting and of both integral equations of the first and second kind in the contemporary Sobolev space setting. In the numerical solution part of the book, the author included a new collocation method for two-dimensional hypersingular boundary integral equations and a collocation method for the three-dimensional Lippmann-Schwinger equation. The final chapter of the book on inverse boundary value problems for the Laplace equation has been largely rewritten with special attention to the trilogy of decomposition, iterative and sampling methodsReviews of earlier editions:"This book is an excellent introductory text for students, scientists, and engineers who want to learn the basic theory of linear integral equations and their numerical solution."(Math. Reviews, 2000)"This is a good introductory text book on linear integral equations. It contains almost all the topics necessary for a student. The presentation of the subject matter is lucid, clear and in the proper modern framework without being too abstract." (ZbMath, 1999)},

	abstract = {Chemosensory movement of bacteria toward the cloud of leaked material around planktonic algae has been suggested as an important aspect of bacterial nutrition in aquatic ecosystems. Inability of bacteria to keep pace with falling algae has been suggested as inhibiting such interactions. The interaction between bacteria and falling particles, including microalgae, is explored with a simulation model of bacterial chemotaxis that incorporates low Reynolds number fluid flow and resulting substrate spatial distributions. Results show that although bacteria cannot maintain a position relative to a falling particle unless the particle is extremely large, such as a marine snow aggregate, chemosensory response does allow them to stay in the high substrate environment of the leaky particle longer than if they did not have it. The ecological significance for bacterial metabolism depends on several factors, including the frequency of contact between algae and bacteria and the relative concentrations of substrate at the cell surface and in the background. Optimal enhancement should occur in eutrophic conditions of large algal cells present in high abundances. Presently available values for the ratio of substrate concentration next to the algal cell relative to that in solution are not large enough to suggest that the microzones around algal cells provide significant enhancement of bacterial nutrition. Chemotaxis should enhance interactions with large marine snow aggregates, both by allowing bacteria to stay for significant periods around them and by enhancing the rates at which bacteria attach to the aggregate surfaces. This enhancement is greater for surfaces in which there is a lower probability of sticking.},

associated with the 22.4 σt density surface. A second thin layer of elevated phytoplankton concentration located at a density discontinuity 1.5 to 2 m above the marine snow layer occurred within a dense diatom bloom
near the surface. At the end of the study period, isopycnals shoaled and the 2 layers merged. More than 80\% of the diatom bloom consisted of Thalassiosira spp. (50 to 59\%), Odontella longicruris (5 to 14\%), Asterionellopsis glacialis,
and Thalassionema nitzschioides. A much higher proportion of O. longicruris occurred in marine snow (about 53\%) than among suspended cells suggesting that this species differentially aggregated. Most zooplankton avoided the mucus-rich
aggregate layer. The layer of marine snow was formed when sinking aggregated diatoms reached neutral buoyancy at the 22.4 isopycnal, probably due to the presence of low salinity mucus resistant to salt exchange in the interstices of the aggregates. Rates
of turbulent kinetic energy dissipation throughout the water column rarely exceeded 10-8 m2 s-3 and aggregates below the thin layer were largely detrital in composition indicating that small-scale shears due to turbulence
did not erode the layer of marine snow. The accumulation of marine snow and phytoplankton in persistent, discrete layers at density discontinuities results in habitat partitioning of the pelagic zone, impacts the distribution and interactions of
planktonic organisms as well as the intensity and location of biological processes in the water column, and helps maintain species diversity.},
