% In this thesis, we explore both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluid behaviors. 
The first two parts of this thesis presented the settling marine aggregate simulations in an oceanic fluid. 
We are motivated for exploring marine aggregates due to their relevance to global climate change, which is the most significant environmental problem we face today.
The ocean absorbs approximately 40\% of the carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) produced anthropogenically~\cite{omand_sinking_2020}. 
Some amount of CO$_2$ dissolved at the surface of the ocean and fixed by marine aggregates. As they transport the dissolved carbon to the deep sea, the ocean reduces the CO$_2$ level in the atmosphere. 
This process is one of the most important factors playing a role in global warming.
While there are many experimental research works in the oceanography field actively, it may have more limitations to obtain and process the actual marine aggregates than the computational approach. Our ultimate goal of this research is to provide numerical tools to attain useful information regarding the behaviors of marine aggregates.  
Our numerical methods allow users to form a fractal structured aggregate using two algorithms, IAA and CCA. The parameters for surrounding fluid can be easily adjusted in the Stokes approximation. 
We hope to contribute to the oceanic carbon cycle research area by understanding the fluid dynamics of marine aggregates. 


 In particular, the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) dissolved at the surface of the ocean and fixed by micro-organisms is one of the most important factors playing a role in global warming. An important factor affecting the impact of marine aggregates on the carbon cycle is their settling behavior. The focus of our research is the computation of velocity fields and forces acting on aggregates, modeled as a collection of cubes, sinking in an ambient fluid under gravity. Mathematically, under the condition of small differences in density between the particles and fluid, the flow velocity can be expressed by the Stokes approximation which is a well-known model to describe fluid motion.

 With the constitutive rheology code, we can explore many different applications.
